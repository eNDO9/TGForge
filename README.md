# TGForge

TGForge is an interactive data extraction and analysis tool built using Streamlit and Telegram’s official API. It allows users to collect, analyze, and export data from one or more public Telegram channels or groups. With TGForge, you can:

- Retrieve Channel Information: Get basic details about channels—including alternative names, channel type, creation date, and reported member counts.
- Collect Messages: Fetch all messages from selected channels or groups, with an option to filter by specific date ranges. Download the data as CSV or Excel for further analysis.
- Extract Forwards: Focus on forwarded messages, with similar date filtering and download options.
- Fetch Participants: Gather group or channel member information either directly via the API or by extracting active participants from messages. This is ideal for analyzing community engagement and social network interactions.

This tool was created by and for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

It was developed by Nathan Doctor as a part of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

Special thanks to the Streamlit and Telethon for their support.
