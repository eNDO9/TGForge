As reported in mainstream media, all outside visits have been cancelled to New York state prisons.

Around midnight on Thursday, there was a militant uprising at Riverview Correctional Facility in Ogdensburg, forcing correctional officers to retreat, vacate their posts, and call in police and emergency response teams to gain control of the situation. Last week there was another prison uprising at Collins Correctional Facility in Erie County.

Correctional officer pigs are currently on strike in 36 facilities across the state, so Gov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday signed an executive order calling up 3,500 members of the National Guard for service in the remaining unmanned prisons.

Contrary to what District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his Zionist backers might allege, we are not criminals. We are merely community members who chose to risk everything to amplify the voices of the oppressed. We don't see that as wrong, we see it as the bare minimum. Nor are we heroes, for the heroes in this struggle are the people of Palestine and their steadfast resistance fighters, who for 16 months fought and emerged victorious against multiple nuclear powers. All of us present today are here to fight for justice-not just for ourselves, but for all who demand to see a better world. Let this be a moment that galvanizes us to stand together, louder and stronger than ever. We will not stop fighting until justice prevails, not just in the halls of power across the street, but in Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen, and everywhere else imperialism rears its ugly head.

Even though a fragile ceasefire has taken hold in Gaza, President Trump has made brazen statements about the future of the Gaza Strip and its inhabitants, while the Israelis have launched Operation Iron Wall in the West Bank, a military operation that has killed dozens of Palestinians and displaced thousands more. In the face of this, I wish to quote Mohammed el-Kurd, who demands that we ""raise the ceiling of what is permissible."" It's the least we can do. Long live Palestine.

**CUNY 8 Statement, 14 February 2025**

Thank you to everyone who has joined us today in packing the courts, thank you to AFMN for launching this campaign in support of us, thank you to all the speakers, and thank you to all of the organizations who have endorsed this campaign.

We stand before you today as eight individuals who stood in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle against genocide at the CUNY encampment and are now being unjustly targeted with trumped up felony charges. These charges, charges that have loomed over us for nine months, carry the devastating potential of up to seven years of imprisonment. These charges represent a calculated attempt to silence voices of dissent.

This case is not just about the eight of us-it reflects a larger, deeply troubling trend. Around the country and around the world, we are seeing growing efforts to criminalize activism and suppress movements that dare challenge the genocidal intentions of Israel, the United States, and the rest of the so-called West.

These felony charges send a chilling message to anyone who dares challenge systems of power. They seek to intimidate, silence, and isolate us-but, I assure you, we will not be intimidated, we will not be silenced, or, as you all have proven today, we will certainly not be isolated.

The right to protest, to speak out against injustice, and to fight for freedom is not just a fundamental right‚Äîit is our moral duty. When this right is under attack, we are all under threat. We are witnessing the criminalization of political dissent‚Äîa tactic historically used to suppress movements for civil and workers' rights. The modern iteration of this tactic, a neo-McCarthyism that aims to protect Zionism with the iron shield that is accusations of anti-semitism, is the logical endgame of so-called Western democracy, an illusion whose unraveling has hastened since the commencement of Operation Al Aqsa Flood.

If these felony charges result in convictions, it will further magnify the ability of the state to use the law to incarcerate activists in various movements for as long as possible.
We call on all allies, advocates, and organizations to stand with us in this fight. We need your support, not only to combat these charges but to send a clear message that we will not back down.

This is a fight that transcends one issue or one community. Whether you stand for racial justice, Indigenous rights, workers' rights, or global liberation movements just know that you stand against empire, and we must unite against empire.",Text,False,Not Available,None,[],"['https://x.com/taliaotg/status/1890413873905205412)', 'https://x.com/fidaimedia/status/1890410174726201759),', 'https://x.com/fidaimedia)']",91,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/1261,6906.0,26.0,No Replies

By the time Daniela Klette, Burkhard Garweg, and Volker Staub ended up on wanted posters, the group they were accused of belonging to‚Äîthe [**Red Army Faction**](https://files.libcom.org/files/Red%20Army%20Faction%20-%20Projectiles%20For%20The%20People.pdf)‚Äîhad been in existence for over two decades. The RAF was a clandestine organization that had waged armed struggle throughout the 1970s and 1980s in order to create an anti-imperialist pole of resistance in West Germany, as the country was known at the time. Several members died in the course of the struggle, and dozens of guerrillas and their supporters served lengthy prison terms.

It is alleged that Daniela, Burkhard, and Volker were active in the group in its final years, the 1990s. Daniela was captured in 2024, and Burkhard is now the focus of a newly energized manhunt. We have produced this document to inform comrades in the English-speaking world of their situation and politics....

Daniela Klette was captured on February 26, 2024. The apartment building she had been living in was raided, with news reports about dangerous weapons on the premises necessitating the evacuation of the residents. Realizing the police were outside her door, she managed to send a quick text message before disposing of her phone‚Äôs sim card; Burkhard was long gone before police raided the alternative caravan park he had been living in and working at as a caretaker. For the first two months, Daniela was held in a cell constantly under video surveillance and was kept isolated from other prisoners. She was initially charged with participation in thirteen robberies committed between 1999 and 2016 and ‚Äúattempted murder‚Äù (a cash transport vehicle driver was allegedly shot at). A separate trial is being prepared for her based on charges stemming from RAF actions prior to the group‚Äôs dissolution...

The state has targeted a number of former RAF members since the group disbanded, trying to dredge up new charges for actions the group carried out when it was active, often actions that other people have already served years or decades in prison for. The fact that the RAF was active for so long and was never defeated but instead chose to disband, and that most former members have refused to recant or to provide information, sets a precedent that is dangerous to those in power. It is an example they have long hoped to snuff out. Similar to the prosecution of elderly former militants in other countries for actions long past, the goal is to stamp out the memory of a certain kind of resistance, lest it become a factor once again as contradictions unfold and the capitalist edifice crumbles ever more.

We are presenting here a letter from prison by Daniela that was read by actor Rolf Becker at the thirtieth International Rosa Luxemburg Congress in Berlin, on January 11, 2025. We are also presenting a letter by Burkhard that late last year was delivered to the taz, a progressive newspaper with its origins in the 1970s radical left, by an attorney acting on his behalf.

unity_of_fields,1239,unity_of_fields,unity_of_fields,2025-01-30 02:00:44,"Anonymous submission from Columbia:

""Im so scared. Please come."" One year ago today, these were Hind's last words as she called for an ambulance, while Israeli forces unleashed 355 bullets murdering her as she hid in a car. One year ago, the world failed Hind. But today and everyday we owe Hind, all our martyrs, and ourselves, action. 

So today we acted. Inspired by Hind, and the bravery of every Palestinian child who has faced down Israeli genocide for the last century - whether they threw a molotov at a checkpoint, a rock at a tank, or made a call for help. So long as they resist, so must we. We attacked two targets at Columbia University. First, the Kravis Columbia School of Business, one of Columbia's most recent violent gentrification projects into Harlem, the construction of which was conditioned on the creation of Columbia's Apartheid Global Center in ""Tel Aviv"". We will not allow this land-grab to go unchallenged. Second, we attacked the School of International and Public Affairs - the first Columbia institution to expel a student for their support for Palestinian liberation, currently run by a former ""Israeli intelligence officer"" - Killer Keren, and staffed by Rebecca Weiner, head of the Counterterrorism Unit of the NYPD, who directed the brutal police assault on our comrades in Hind's Hall last May. We left Hind's call painted on SIPA, and we cemented the sewage lines of the entire building, forcing them to shut down business-as-usual.

We are not experts in what it means to take revolutionary action. We are people - just like you - who, today, chose to act. We were afraid- to be arrested, suspended, and expelled; and that is exactly the point. The goal is not to be fearless, but to recognize that to be afraid is merely a symptom of our moral clarity. We are soberly aware of what we may lose if we act, and we are soberly aware of how much more we will lose if we don't. The most severe consequence we could face today is not expulsion or prison time- it is the knowledge that we had the opportunity to act, and, instead, chose cowardice. The most severe consequence we could face is not only to have failed Hind one year ago, but to have continued to fail her today. 
 
So we invite you to join us. Let us identify the actions that elicit fear in us, find the people who we can be courageous with, embrace the fear, and take collective action.

As Hind's mother watched the scene of Hind's Hall unfold, she said ""I wanted these movements and support to come while Hind was still alive and not after... but I was still happy that there's a possibility that Hind's cause could move and mobilize people in this world."" Let us act together and transform that possibility into a reality. 

For Hind, with love and rage from Columbia.",MessageMediaDocument,False,Not Available,None,[],[],116,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/1239,8133.0,38.0,No Replies

On April 15th, 2024 thousands of people around the world participated in an autonomously organized and coordinated economic blockade to free Palestine. ‚ÄúThere is a sense in the streets,‚Äù the proposal for the action stated, ‚Äúin this recent and unprecedented movement for Palestine that escalation has become necessary: there is a need to shift from symbolic actions to those that cause pain to the economy.‚Äù In 82 cities, 19 countries, actions blockaded ports, airports, highways, city squares, and weapons manufacturers, seeing potentially millions of dollars in unrealized profits and over 400 arrests.

62 of those arrests were in Eugene, Oregon, where Interstate 5 was blockaded by cars and protestors for about an hour before over 100 police from state, county, and city departments cleared the highway. Those arrested were charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct in the second degree. The majority of the defendants were offered diversion ‚Äúplea deals,‚Äù while the state singled out three protestors to whom they refused to offer deals, including a Palestinian student organizer. The defendants organized over the following months intentionally to engage in collective defense, hoping that threatening to take 62 cases to trial would be leverage enough to force the state to offer everyone equal treatment or even to drop the charges.

The state refused every attempt at negotiation after rallies, letters, phone zaps, and meetings between the DA and public defenders and movement lawyers. As time went on, and defendants felt the mounting impact of the arrests and pending charges on their housing, jobs, health, and broader lives, more and more defendants accepted the plea deals. Many still intended to take their cases to trial in solidarity with their comrades facing more serious repression. 11 trials occurred between October 2024 and January 2025, with 11 guilty verdicts returned. Defendants attempted to put the US government‚Äôs unwavering support of genocide on trial, using pre-trial ‚Äòchoice of evils‚Äô hearings to bring in experts to testify about Palestine and direct action, such as a UN special rapporteur, and taking the stand themselves to explain their actions.

The state attempted at every avenue to de-politicize the action, framing it as a case about ‚Äúselfishness,‚Äù and judges frequently denied defendants‚Äô ability to even talk about Palestine on the stand, while also rejecting expert testimony or defense strategies that could bring the US funding of genocide into view. When it came time for the Palestinian student activist to go to trial along with their Lebanese co-defendant, it seemed like all strategies of collective defense had failed. The ‚Äúchoice of evils‚Äù pre-trial hearing ended with the judge refusing multiple expert witnesses the ability to testify in front of the jury about US complicity in the genocide in Palestine.

Yet, at the end of the trial, the jury returned a ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù verdict, acquitting both defendants. Was it jury nullification? Was it simply that the state‚Äôs clear political repression of Palestine solidarity was more evident than ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of crime? Was it the defendant‚Äôs powerful testimony on their personal relationship to the land, people, and resistance in Palestine and Lebanon? All we know is that the state failed in all regards ‚Äìespecially in its attempt to repress Palestine solidarity actions, collective solidarity, and the individual Palestinian activist they singled out, and we know that together we are stronger than the state‚Äôs best efforts to repress us.

Our hearts are bursting with love and rage for those behind the closed doors of the jury deliberation room who remained steadfast in their determination not to participate in the state‚Äôs repression of Palestine solidarity!

The immoral life sentence of American Indian Movement freedom fighter, political prisoner and prisoner of war, Leonard Peltier was commuted by the U.S. President Joe Biden, only moments before Biden‚Äôs term in office ended. Now 80 years old, Peltier languished for over 50 years in prison after being unjustly convicted of killing two FBI agents in 1975 during a terror raid of the Pine Ridge Reservation by agents of the U.S. government.

Biden‚Äôs clemency order for Peltier was a vulgar, narcissistic attempt to fabricate a benevolent legacy for himself. Falling far short of an exoneration, the Biden administration insinuated the act was one of compassion for a decidedly ‚Äúguilty‚Äù FBI agent killer. The ailing elder Peltier won‚Äôt be released until February 18th, and will still have to remain confined to house arrest for the rest of his life under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Prisons that can rescind his release if they decide he has violated his parole. At least he will be surrounded and cared for by loved ones.

While the Black Alliance for Peace (BAP) welcomes the long overdue release of Leonard Peltier, we hold that he should never have been imprisoned and that his imprisonment reflects the ongoing institutional expression of settler-colonialism that defines the U.S. Even though all evidence in the case of Peltier points to his innocence, BAP‚Äôs commitment to an authentic process of decolonization in every sense of that term supports the right of American Indian, First Nation people to defend themselves and resist their colonialist domination by any means necessary.

Neither Biden nor the U.S. government deserves credit or gratitude for commuting Peltier's sentence. All credit belongs to the activists, international human rights leaders, and legal advocates led by the Indigenous people who fought for decades for Leonard Peltier‚Äôs release. Peltier‚Äôs case is but one in a long and decadent history of U.S. political imprisonment and repression, with a present record that includes the contemporary cases of the Uhuru 3, the nearly five dozen ‚ÄúStop Cop City‚Äù activists indicted on RICO charges, and activists targeted in the Free Palestine movement.

BAP holds the U.S. setter state in contempt for continuing to hold political prisoners and we remain ‚Äúcommitted to working against all forms of state and domestic repression, including the issues of political prisoners and prisoners of war in the United States.‚Äù

This action was taken following dozens of actions across the country targeting citibank for its role in funding and profiting from genocide in Gaza and ongoing colonial exploitation of Haiti. Citibank first built its riches through the exploitation of Haiti, funneling wealth from the newly independent nation and facilitating the 1915 american military invasion and occupation. Today, citibank continues to profit from war and colonial expansion. The firm is the largest american bank operating in ""israel"" and its investments fuel both the continued settler invasion of occupied Palestine and the zionist entity's genocidal assault of Gaza. We welcome the news of the ceasefire in Gaza as a victory of the Palestinian resistance and a respite for the people of Gaza who have been abandoned and betrayed by the world. But, the zionist project of ethnically cleansing all of Palestine continues, as does citibank's complicity.

I wrote this on the plane and I‚Äôm posting it just after landing at Istanbul. On Monday evening I was brought to Zurich airport in handcuffs, in a small metal cage inside a windowless prison van and led all the way to the plane by police. This is after three days and two nights in a Swiss prison cut off from communication with the outside world, in a cell 24 hours a day with one cell mate, not even permitted to contact my family. On Saturday in a police interview in the presence of my lawyer they accused me of ‚Äúoffending against Swiss law‚Äù without ever telling me what crime I had committed in Switzerland or listing any charges. As far as I know I have not been charged with any crime whatsoever and I was held in ‚Äúadministrative detention.‚Äù On Sunday morning, they took me from my cell for questioning by Swiss defense ministry intelligence agents without the presence of my lawyer, and they again refused to allow me to contact her or my family. I refused to talk to them without my lawyer and told them take me back to my cell. During my imprisonment I refused every meal and every cup of coffee or tea they offered me except the last meal, after I knew I would be going home. I accepted only water, which is the right of every human being. All of this was after I was abducted off the street around 1:30pm on Saturday while on my way to the Palestine teach-in by undercover agents, handcuffed, forced into an unmarked car and sped straight to the prison. My ‚Äúcrime‚Äù? Being a journalist who speaks up for Palestine and against Israel‚Äôs genocide and settler-colonial savagery and those who aid and abet it. I came to Switzerland at the invitation of Swiss citizens to talk about justice for Palestine, to talk about accountability for a genocide in which Switzerland too is complicit. But while I was hauled off to prison like a dangerous criminal before I even had a chance to say a word, the Israeli president Isaac Herzog, who declared at the start of the genocide that there are no civilians in Gaza, no innocents, received a red carpet welcome in Davos, a carpet soaked in the blood of the more than 47,000 known victims of the genocide and the thousands more still under the rubble, or who died of deliberately inflicted starvation and denial of medical care. And on this very day Netanyahu freely travels to Poland to make a mockery of the Auschwitz commemoration despite an outstanding ICC arrest warrant. That is the perverse, unjust world we live in. This ordeal lasted three days but that taste of prison was more than enough to leave me in even greater awe of the Palestinian heroes who endure months and years in the prisons of the genocidal oppressor. More than ever I know that the debt we owe them is one we can never repay and all of them must be free and they must remain our focus. The police gave me my phone back only at the gate of the plane so I‚Äôm only seeing now the extent of the overwhelming support and solidarity from all over the world. I‚Äôm deeply grateful to each and every person who stood up for me. I‚Äôm especially grateful to my lawyer Dina Raewel and her team, to our friends in Zurich who I learned afterwards demonstrated outside the prison, to my family and my colleagues at EI and so many others. I honestly had no idea what was happening outside that concrete room! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

At the behest of British Imperialiam and it's terrorist agency MI5, the Free State administration have held Cork Republican Se√°n Walsh in Portlaoise Prison for 4 years without crime or trial.

This week as part of Se√°n's fight against British Extradition, his solicitors appeared is to before the the European Courts in Luxembourg and argued that Extradition to the Occupied 6 Counties would be a gross breach of Se√°n's Human Rights, due to the wide ranging changes to the British Justice System under the terms of Brexit. The court is to rule next month on if the Free State should comply with the orders of British Imperialiam. 

It should be noted that Se√°n is the only Republican currently facing extradition that is interned, with others being freed on bail. No Irish Republican should be extradited on the orders of British Imperialiam. Se√°n should be immediately released and the Free State should immediately drop the Extradition cases against all Irish Republicans before the courts. 

As Irish Republicans we know that no Republican can find justice in British Occupied Ireland. For the Free State to go through with any extradition of Irish Republicans is not only a betrayal of our country and our people, but in reality an unforgivable human rights crime.

Se√°n Walsh's case is now in the critical moment. In the weeks ahead, all Republicans regardless of organisational affiliation must raise their voice against the Extradition of Irish Republicans. Demanding the release of Se√°n Walsh is something that all Republicans across the 32 Counties can unite around. While it is Se√°n Walsh today it could be any Irish Republican that British Imperialiam decides to target tomorrow.

Anti Imperialist Action Ireland will be stepping up our Anti extradition campaign in the weeks ahead and are willing to work with all Genuine Republicans on this issue

23 years ago, Ahmad Sa‚Äôadat, General Secretary of the PFLP, was deceived and lured by the PA‚Äîacting in coordination with the Zionists‚Äîinto Yasser Arafat‚Äôs compound. This betrayal culminated in the compound‚Äôs siege, his arrest, imprisonment in Jericho, and eventual handover to the Zionist entity. This treachery exemplifies the PA‚Äôs long-standing role as a tool of imperialism and collaborator with the Zionist regime, betraying the Palestinian liberation struggle and the very people it claims to serve.

Since its inception, the PA has never represented the aspirations of decolonization or resistance. Instead, it has upheld the Zionist colonial project, acting as a comprador class that has sold out the Palestinian cause.

Today, this treason continues as the PA wages a siege on the Resistance in Jenin refugee camp, imprisoning fighters in its torture dungeons, starving the camp‚Äôs people, and paving the way for Zionist incursions. The collaboration between the PA and the Zionist entity was on full display as PA forces arrested resistance fighters fleeing the besieged camp, further aiding Israel‚Äôs war against the Palestinian people.

What‚Äôs happening in Jenin‚Äîraids, airstrikes, mass arrests‚Äîreflects the Zionist regime‚Äôs long-term colonial strategy: seize more land, crush resistance, and displace Palestinians. The PA‚Äôs role in this campaign is treasonous, as it enforces colonial violence while the occupation intensifies its aggression.

Even the ceasefire in Gaza has not stopped the Zionist entity‚Äôs brutality in the West Bank, with Jenin‚Äîa cradle of resistance‚Äîremaining a target. Yet, despite this betrayal and the ongoing violence, the spirit of liberation in Jenin remains unbroken, as the enemy continues to fail in its attempts to suppress the Resistance.

The march concluded at the Zionist embassy.

Down with Zionism, down with collaborators, down with traitors.

Freedom for Ahmad Sa‚Äôadat and all Palestinian prisoners.

The 60-day period for the Zionist enemy to permanently withdraw from Lebanese territory is about to end, and this necessitates its full and comprehensive implementation in accordance with what was stated in the ceasefire agreement.

Certain leaks concerning the enemy postponing its withdrawal and staying longer in Lebanon require everyone‚Äîespecially the political leadership in Lebanon and those pressuring the countries sponsoring the agreement‚Äîto act effectively and closely the last days of the deadline in a way that guarantees the implementation of the complete withdrawal, the deployment of the Lebanese army to every inch of Lebanese territory, the swift return of residents to their villages, and the prevention of any excuses or arguments for prolonging the occupation.

Any violation of the 60-day period constitutes a blatant violation of the agreement, an attack on Lebanese sovereignty, and the beginning of a new chapter of occupation. This demands that the state confront it using all means and methods sanctioned by international conventions to reclaim the land and wrest it from the grip of the occupation.

As we continue to the developments of the situation, which are supposed to culminate in a full withdrawal in the coming days, we affirm that any breach of the agreement or attempt to evade commitments under weak pretexts will not be tolerated.

Today, thousands of people across the world organized events and took collective action in honor of Manuel ""Tortuguita"" Ter√°n who was murdered by Georgia State Troopers two years ago while protesting the construction of Cop City in Atlanta. Tortuguita died defending the Weelaunee Forest. January 18, the Day of the Forest Defender, commemorates their 26 years on this earth and their steadfast commitment to collective liberation. Their spirit is alive in our resistance.

We, the writers of this message, took over a billboard on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, one of NYC's largest highways, used by 130,000 vehicles daily. We covered a CopShot police billboard‚Äîthat recruits informants with a $10,000 bribe‚Äîwith a tribute to Tortuguita and all land defenders. In the context of a city that spends $29 million dollars a day on policing, off the side of a highway that displaced thousands of families with a stroke of a pen, we replace the state's cowardly propaganda with a commemoration of land defenders' sacrifice and struggle. Collective memory animates our will to destroy this empire that is killing us and our planet. As the US funnels billions into building Cop Cities across the country in its latest attempt to repress us, they concede what we already know‚Äîthat rebellion is inevitable.

""While struggles in Vietnam and Algeria inspired movements for peace in the West, they were received as a call for war in the Third World ‚Äì namely a people‚Äôs war. The difference is striking, and it remains palpable today in the widely divergent aims and respective strategies employed to achieve them, including in **the largely pacifist orientation of much Palestine solidarity organising in the West**...

If it is to have any meaningful role in the political terrain opened by the Flood, **the solidarity movement must re-examine both its form and content in line with the people‚Äôs war**, including its current objectives as well as its long-term ambitions.

In concrete terms, this will of course depend on a practical evaluation of the movement‚Äôs situation and conditions in any one locale. All the same, the task likely entails a reappraisal of some broad and characteristic features, which should provide the movement with a departure point rather than a terminus. Key among these is its spontaneity, which may have been a necessary condition for its emergence, but which is wholly insufficient for and antithetical to its continuation, let alone its escalation. Without **a concerted political program giving it strategic and ideological clarity**, the movement is unlikely to acquire a form adequate to the task at hand...

**Court support and the plea agreement hearing this past Tuesday**

We estimate that up to 100 people turned out in support of Casey at their plea agreement hearing on Tuesday, 1/14. Supporters and family filled several pews in the courtroom with many more in the lobby outside and even more downstairs outside the federal building where the local Coffee Not Cops collective supported with coffee, tea, and snacks over the course of the afternoon.

In brief, the judge accepted the plea agreement and the terms of the negotiated plea agreement were read out. 

After the hearing was adjourned, outside the courthouse, a statement prepared by Casey and their legal team was read to supporters and press.

__""Dr. Goonan plead guilty today to one count of arson and took responsibility for four additional arsons. As outlined in the plea agreement, these acts were undertaken in response to the University of California's and the federal government's treatment of pro-Palestine protesters.

Dr. Goonan's sentencing will occur on April 8th, Related to the sentencing hearing Dr. Goonan will provide additional information contextualizing their actions within Dr. Goonan's mental health struggles and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.""__

We have already spoken with Casey on the phone and let them know about all the support and love for them inside and outside the courtroom. They send their love and thanks to all!

Requests and guidelines for letters of character to be included in Casey's pre-sentencing report will be forthcoming soon. Stay tuned.

Casey will still be at Santa Rita Jail up through their sentencing process.

Casey is still in need of ongoing support to cover increasing legal fees. Though they‚Äôve had some great support, we are nowhere near the goal to cover the costs of this trial. The plea agreement also includes restitution charges which, in addition to legal costs, will likely more than double the currently estimated financial burden of this case.

""Starting in May 2020 the U.S. was shaken by protests, uprisings, and riots following the police murder of George Floyd. Almost immediately the government moved in to repress those taking the streets against the police and racial violence. **More than 350 people were arrested on federal charges while city and state level arrests topped 14,000 between May 28th and Nov 3rd**. Some cities/regions already had established organizations and crews to help with both jail support and long-term prisoner support during and after the Uprising; in other places new groups formed as the need arose; yet other places still have little or no infrastructure to support the massive number of arrestees. 

The uprising was the continuation of a battle against the combined powers of the state and white supremacy that has been raging for decades; centuries. That fight does not end when the protests die down or the riots are quelled. It overlaps with other moments of rupture and with the care that we show for each other in the aftermath of repression and the build up towards the next moment. The struggle continues. And for that reason, we do not want those captured by the state to be isolated through their imprisonment and left out of that continuing struggle. We want to facilitate their connections with people, movements, and communities on the outside; this website is one piece of that effort.""

[**Gaza: The Resistance Lives, The Prison Doors Open ‚Äì On the Road to Liberation and Return**](https://samidoun.net/2025/01/gaza-the-resistance-lives-the-prison-doors-open-on-the-road-to-liberation-and-return/)

...It is very clear, given the role of the United States and incoming President Donald Trump in seeking to actually achieve a ceasefire prior to the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025, for the first time since October 2023, that **the US, as the leading imperialist power, directs the Zionist entity. Not only did the US never attempt to achieve a ceasefire, it was the primary director of the escalated genocidal assault on the Palestinian people**, alongside the Zionist colony implanted in Palestine. Of course, it was joined in this aggression ‚Äì on the Palestinian people, the Arab nation, the entire region, and indeed, all of humanity, by its fellow imperialist powers ‚Äì Canada, Britain, Australia, Germany, France and other European Union members ‚Äì but it has been apparent to all, as the US ships billions of dollars in deadly weaponry to the Zionist regime and implanted a faux ‚Äúaid pier‚Äù only to support an attack killing hundreds of Palestinians in Nuseirat camp, that the US ordered the genocide and could stop it at any time.

**Of course, the US is not acting now to preserve Palestinian lives, but for domestic political concerns and to focus its attention on imperial interests elsewhere**. But the fundamental nature of this assault as an imperialist-zionist genocide, carried out with US weapons and intelligence, is not only etched firmly into history, so too is the reputation of ‚ÄúGenocide Joe‚Äù Biden, ‚ÄúKiller Kamala‚Äù Harris and the Democratic Party, in presiding over the incineration of tens of thousands of precious Palestinian lives and the destruction of every university and hospital in Gaza...

**The International Popular Cradle of the Resistance**

At the international level, **this is a critical moment not to step back and to de-escalate, but to intensify and deepen our efforts to build the international popular cradle of the resistance**. Millions of people filled the streets, in the heart of the imperialist core, to demand an end to the genocide and justice and liberation for Palestine. It is clear to everyone around the world that the Zionist regime is a genocidal threat to humanity. The resistance surmounted the lies and smear campaigns waged against them in an attempt to justify genocide and stand tall today as true heroes of humanity. The Palestinian and Arab people in exile and diaspora rose up everywhere to organize, come together, and play their role in the struggle for Palestine‚Äôs liberation. Direct actions like those of Palestine Action, confronting the war machine, have shut down weapons factories and offices of Israeli arms dealers. Students changed the picture of campus life everywhere as they rose up in a global intifada. The growing popular and grassroots boycott illustrated international popular revulsion and refusal of complicity in genocide. And yet, we also have key lessons to learn: **We cannot have a successful movement or serve as a partner to the resistance without being clear on the role of imperialism, and equally clear on the centrality of the resistance forces**. We cannot allow our movement to be taken down the road of imperialist party politics, competing over who is in charge of the theft of Palestinian lives.

**Unity and the Necessity of Anti-Imperialism**

Our strength and our unity comes from standing together against repression, and for liberation, not in allowing our enemies to cut us off from one another through a politics that seeks accommodation within genocidal imperialism, self-censorship and subordination. **It is, at the core, the armed resistance, the Palestinian prisoners, and of course, the people of Gaza, who exposed Zionism and imperialism** and brought down all of their military objectives, who are opening the doors of freedom for the heroic prisoners of the cause of Palestine, and who promise a Palestinian future that will be determined only by the people and not by its occupiers, invaders and enemies...",Text,False,Not Available,None,[],['https://samidoun.net/2025/01/gaza-the-resistance-lives-the-prison-doors-open-on-the-road-to-liberation-and-return/)'],85,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/1134,1984.0,8.0,No Replies

Brick by brick we can tear down the pillars of zionism, fascism, and imperialism.

Get with your trusted comrades, meet with phones in another room, brainstorm, practice, learn new skills, assess your risk tolerances, be mindful of legal consequences, start small, make mistakes on low stakes actions, act with conscience, punish the ruling class, and document responsibly.

Get Tor browser, read guides from Pal Action, Unity Of Fields, notrace, neversleep.noblogs.org, and others.

""Escalate"" is not just a slogan, or a vague, elusive concept, it's a process. If you're willing to be arrested for blocking a roadway, think about what other effective action you can do without intentionally being arrested. When a Barclay's executive in the UK said they can tolerate peaceful pickets outside their branches, but not when all their branches get smashed repeatedly, he told us exactly what to do. And it's not to protest in acceptable ways that they can ignore.

Repeated, sustained, direct action gets the goods. We can do more than the ruling class would have us believe. Free Palestine. Free your mind.

**SENTENCING STATEMENT**

On Monday, January 6, with roughly 40 supporters of Pep and Krystal packing the room, Judge Nicholas Ranjan heard arguments from the prosecution and the defense, and a Victim Impact Statement read by a University of Pittsburgh police officer. Ranjan then agreed to the non-cooperating stipulated plea and sentenced the two. 

**SENTENCING DETAILS**

Pep was sentenced to serve 60 months in BOP. As he‚Äôs served 18 months already, he anticipates being eligible to transition to a halfway house around March 2026 (between 15 and 22 months). After that, he will be on supervised release for 3 years. Krystal was sentenced to 3 years of supervised release and 80 hours of community service.
Pep and Krystal were jointly sentenced to pay $50,225.03, mostly to University Of Pittsburgh Officer TH, with a smaller sum to the University of Pittsburgh. They also were given special assessments of $200 and $100, respectively, and sentenced to repayment of some costs of prosecution and their own punishment. Critically, however, there was no further fine.

Pep and Krystal issued a joint statement:

**‚ÄúWe hold in our gravity a deep reverence for love beyond the limited words we have. We know the devoted embrace of solidarity ‚Äì people leaning in to one another against involuntary servitude and for a world of mutual aid.

If we are convicted, it is of love for each other, and for our community, to which all brave hearts beat devotion to the impossible task of liberation. We are grateful for those who care take, for without you, freedom would be even more distant.‚Äù**

**NEXT STEPS**

Pep has been transferred out of Butler County Prison and is now at Northeast Ohio Correctional Center where he will be temporarily held while he awaits BOP classification. He may be moved around a bit before ending up at his designated facility within the BOP. We‚Äôll update the [Write To Peppy](http://freepeppyandkrystal.blackblogs.org/write-to-peppy) page on our website as soon as he gets there.

In the meantime, you can also [email us](https://freepeppyandkrystal.blackblogs.org/free-peppy-and-krystal/) messages of solidarity to Peppy or Krystal. We‚Äôll hold on to them and be sure they reach him in the prison where he‚Äôll be doing his time.

You can find more information about the federal BOP initial intake and orientation process [here](https://freepeppyandkrystal.blackblogs.org/write-to-peppy/). We will be sure to update everyone with the necessary information on how best to support Peppy once he actually gets to the BOP.

**DONATIONS**

Peppy and Krystal need your support! In their sentencing, they‚Äôre jointly tasked with paying more than $50k dollars in restitution. This is in addition to commissary and the costs of prison support for the remainder of Peppy‚Äôs sentence. Please [donate](https://freepeppyandkrystal.blackblogs.org/donate/) today and spread the word!

Libya, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Iran have been countries that hampered the hegemony of this ever-expanding [imperialist] buffer zone by training, housing, funding and arming the Palestinian resistance, and for that reason, **color revolutions have been instigated to allow for the Zionist entity to enjoy its expansionist project unabashedly** with the help of the Zionist Arabs and the NATO proxies in the region...

While surely the Axis of Resistance has received a major blow and needs to reorganize and restrategize vis-√°-vis the proliferation of imperialism in Syria given the victory of the Zionist Islamists (they literally thanked the Zionist entity for supporting them in overthrowing the Syrian government), the compass remains Palestine.

**The ongoing genocide in Gaza ought to be our compass and standing with‚Äìideologically and materially‚Äìthe anti-imperialist forces should be the prime focus**. The enemy is no longer on the other side of the border; the enemy of Palestinian liberation is within us, and it starts with educating and mobilizing against the local functionaries of imperialism.

üîª[**The Enemy at Home: U.S. Imperialism in Syria**](https://viewpointmag.com/2018/02/01/enemy-home-u-s-imperialism-syria/),** Patrick Higgins (excerpts)**

It is probably Syria that has most flabbergasted and divided the Western left. It is also the most recent site of direct U.S. military occupation... This divisiveness around Syria only makes it all the more important to comprehend. **We cannot meaningfully oppose U.S. imperialism anywhere if we compromise or make the slightest peace with it in Syria**...

The significance of these details cannot be understated, for they indicate that **sections of U.S. capital not only depend on undermining Syrian sovereignty**, but on destroying the Syrian state and evaporating its wealth, in what amounts to an unspeakably violent episode of looting...

**Those of us living inside of the beast have an internationalist obligation to amass whatever forces possible to antagonize, obstruct, and ultimately shut down these networks of war**. In doing so, we must recognize that we face an enemy with which partial compromises amount to total compromises...In the most practical sense, we cannot oppose U.S. imperialism anywhere if we actively or passively accept it in Syria. **To oppose U.S. imperialism is to oppose capitalism itself**. Conversely, the successes of U.S. imperialism in Syria strengthens its profits, and thus its expansive capacities elsewhere, from¬†Honduras¬†and¬†Colombia¬†to¬†Niger¬†and the¬†Philippines, and beyond...

Still, the question remains as to what constituencies can be mobilized in such a moment. On that front, there already exists a growing and serious solidarity between the Palestinian and Black liberation movements, itself built on earlier groundwork and linkages made in the 1960s and 70s. **Any resurgent antiwar effort would have to meet those movements at an intersection and articulate itself in a way that corresponds to their strategic needs while helping to broaden their analyses of the imperialist enemy before us. If this could be successfully executed, we would have a viable force capable of employing a wide range of confrontational tactics against the corporate headquarters of global war, much the way the Black liberation movement had done with the peace movement against the war on Vietnam generations prior**, bequeathing us a precious revolutionary anti-imperialist tradition that expressed the importance of having inside the United States a force fundamentally against the United States. __Another Vietnam, indeed.

__The U.S. Must Stop Supporting Right-Wing Forces to Advance Its‚Äô Geopolitical Agenda__

Around the world, many hoped that the Russia-negotiated agreement in 2020 between the Syrian, government and the coterie of right-wing Jihadist forces, common criminals and other forces against the government of President Bashar Al-Assad, would finally end the nightmare of war, displacement, torture, and mindless destruction suffered by the Syrian people ‚Äì victims of¬† U.S. plans to overthrow all the major nations in the Middle-East that might challenge continued U.S. domination. However, just a few days ago, like cancer, **the disease of U.S. imperialism has suddenly metastasized**. The Black Alliance for Peace argues that current U.S. imperialist actions in Syria need to be placed in a historical context. It is important to remember that **the vicious subversion of Syria, which began in earnest in 2011, was only one of the two criminal assaults that year on nations perceived to be obstacles to U.S. regional hegemony. The other under U.S. assault was¬†Libya**. In Libya, however, the Western-orchestrated assault resulted in not only the overthrow of the government but the country‚Äôs leader, Muammar Gaddafi, being raped and murdered by the right-wing Jihadist friends of the U.S.

**Linking the U.S. imperialist assault on Syria to that of Libya is important because it informs how the few authentic anti-imperialist forces that still exist in the U.S. understand and articulate opposition to the moves being made by U.S. and Western imperialism in their desperate attempts to avoid the inevitable end of white world dominance**. Our positionality in relationship to the Pan-European white supremacist colonial/capitalist patriarchy compels us to remind our friends and sometimes allies, that **they cannot pretend to be in solidarity with Palestine and then cheer on the overthrow of one of the few states in the world that has never turned its back on Palestinian people, no matter what one might think of the internal politics of the Syrian state**.

Such concerns about the nature of the Syrian state became a cover for defending U.S. imperialism and were expressed by dishonest actors or those who were politically naive. Now that the U.S.-backed jihadists have emerged triumphant hope for authentic self-determination for the Syrian people has once again been delayed.¬†

Trump‚Äôs absurd claim that the U.S. does not have anything to do with Syria is only a reflection of why he will never gain full control over the state and non-state apparatus that is directing U.S. foreign policy. The notion that whoever is sitting in the white house represents the final and only power of the U.S. state is dangerously naive. Just recall when Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated a ceasefire with Russia in Deir Ezzor, Syria only to have it ignored by his [generals and CIA](https://english.almanar.com.lb/35495). ¬†¬†

...Meanwhile, coordinated struggle between prisoners and outside militants has been a key point of success for Palestinian liberation.

We must recognize the necessity of attacking the infrastructure of occupation domestically. **Amidst calls for escalation, it is of vital importance to defend those experiencing repression from the legal system. To not do so is to allow one of the state‚Äôs most well-funded and structured counterinsurgency tactics to take complete hold of movements. If people are abandoned to incarceration, the fear of repression will throw everyone towards inactivity**. This need for defense is especially true for those facing charges beyond the more palatable ways of dissent, like marches and encampments.

State repression must be met with expanding our community resources to reach those inside. Bravery must be met with support.

It‚Äôs not surprising that, despite the large presence of the Palestinian diaspora in the American pro-Palestine movement,** tactics focus primarily on vocalizing dissent through marches and making demands of the state, which are a far cry from the struggle within Palestine itself. **This is partially attributed to the class character of the diaspor**a** ‚Äî a petty bourgeois group would have no investment in attacking infrastructure they partially benefit from even if that same infrastructure perpetuates the genocide of indigenous groups including Black people and Palestinians both domestically and globally. **Equally, the motivations and interests of the community organizations and student groups that are largely in control of the movement not only harbor that class character but also rely on funding from the infrastructure they refuse to attack**. Despite the student movement being referred to as an intifada, it‚Äôs activity is incomparable to what has occurred during the numerous intifadas leading up to the Al-Aqsa Flood.

Considering pro-Palestinian community groups and political organizations like USPCN, CJP/SJP, Dissenters, NAARPR, JVP and PSL are supplied with enough funds to bus people in for marches, plan conferences, and campaign for local policy, **certainly donating money towards legal fees for those facing repression would be no issue.**

Even with all the attention and credibility being given to the pro-Palestinian student movement and despite the numerous pro-Palestine student groups on university campuses, there have been no publicly circulated student-led support efforts for Casey. Outside of participants of the [Columbia University encampment](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/06/columbia-university-hinds-hall-defendants-reject-deals-in-solidarity-with-the-cuny-22/), there has been no mention of them from any other university space, most likely attributed to groups aligning themselves with certain tactics, a hesitancy towards anarchists, and the fear of repression. 

Beyond the bare minimum of ensuring people are supported in obtaining adequate legal counsel, any revolutionary horizons with teeth require long term prisoner support. This practice is key to the current struggle that led to the Al-Aqsa Flood as exhibited by the rich history of organizing within prisons and the [ongoing liberation](https://t.me/thecradlemedia/27031) of those being held hostage by Israel. [In Khalida Jarrar‚Äôs](http://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/Jz6ms0AOdXyXGTRgNZMHUMcn/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZeTuUmo9VOHtqrD8p3D6m9-ru33auwkJLzKDbbXrjbaYVBTkv9FJ3hJTU_aem_Ix2VoqDwEQtZMs8Rnpwc6w) words, ‚Äú[t]he ongoing conquest to liberate prisoners is in tandem with the Palestinians‚Äô constant and multifaceted struggle against colonialism. Hence, the slogan ‚Äúemptying the prisons‚Äù is derived from and a core component in the Palestinian struggle through various stages in its history.‚Äù.

**Those of us living under a plantation economy already have our own reasons to ensure incarceration is a central site of struggle**. But if one does insist upon taking guidance from elsewhere and if one intends to ‚Äúbring the Intifada home‚Äù or ‚Äúescalate for Gaza‚Äù, Palestinians have provided plenty of methods for how carcerality can be attacked...

**Casey Goonan is the only US political prisoner from the 2024 pro-Palestine student encampments**. They are an abolitionist and anarchist who has dedicated themselves to multiple forms of prisoner support work and directly engaging with incarcerated comrades. The impact they've made inside is prevalent, as indicated by statements from their comrades [Stevie Wilson](https://www.bellyzine.net/essays/statement-of-solidarity-with-casey-goonan-by-stevie-wilson) and [Hybachi Lemar](https://www.helpacompacontinuehismission.com/2024/07/24/message-of-support-to-free-casey-goonan-free-them-all/). They've always pushed to ensure an understanding of Black struggle and revolt as central to their abolitionist work, and through understanding the totality of anti-Blackness the importance of an anti-police and anti-prison perspective was brought into any and all of their efforts towards liberation.

In June of 2024, they were arrested by a task force comprised of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in connection with an alleged direct action which took place in solidarity with the UC Berkeley encampments which had been brutalized by police and zionists earlier in the year[*](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDHvnLbvNru/) . If convicted, they could face up to 20 years in prison with a minimum sentence of 5. The investigation and court proceedings are currently ongoing but [a non cooperative plea deal](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDgB-HRIHKz/) is pending in which Casey will plea guilty to one charge to allow additional charges to be dropped. This plea deal does not include information or testimony against anyone else.

**While Casey has received a great amount of support from decentralized community in New York, Chicago, California, and elsewhere, the pro-Palestine movement needs to be publicly and actively supporting them**. Right now, their primary accomplices are those who personally know them, those who prioritize prisoner support, and fellow anarchists. **Despite vague assertions of the interconnectedness of repression and struggles between the American policing and prison apparatuses to that of Israel, there has been little material manifestation from that understanding within the US pro-Palestine movement**...

‚Ä¢ What did the enemy achieve through its aggression on Lebanon? It assassinated Hezbollah leaders, including the martyr Sayyed, and committed heinous crimes against civilians. However, it failed to break the stronghold of the resistance, and its actions do not qualify as achievements.

‚Ä¢ The enemy has realized that a confrontation with Hezbollah is futile and will not lead to its victory, prompting it to resort to a ceasefire agreement.

‚Ä¢ We endured hundreds of Israeli violations during this period to facilitate the agreement's implementation, expose the enemy, and hold all of the concerned parties before their responsibilities.

‚Ä¢ In Hezbollah, we monitor developments and act according to our assessment of the interests and unfolding events.

‚Ä¢ The legitimacy of the resistance stems from its faith in its cause, regardless of its capabilities.

‚Ä¢ Victory lies in steadfastness and the continuity of this resistance.

‚Ä¢ Hezbollah's resistance continues with faith and preparation.

‚Ä¢ We do not know when the resistance will ultimately defeat this occupier. It sometimes wins and sometimes faces setbacks, but the essential aspect is its perseverance and presence on the battlefield.

‚Ä¢ Victory is maintaining the resistance and ignoring the discordant voices that reflect despair and reactionary behavior.

‚Ä¢ We say: come to a resistance that has proven its effectiveness and demonstrated that this enemy cannot withdraw except through resistance.

‚Ä¢ This aggression was stopped at the borders through the solidarity of our people and loved ones.

‚Ä¢ Every phase has its own methods and approaches; some changes occurred, but the key is for the resistance to endure.

‚Ä¢ The enemy is contemplating settlements in Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank, backed entirely by the US.

‚Ä¢ They have destroyed all the Syrian army‚Äôs capabilities under various pretexts, which clearly reflects their expansionist agenda, aiming to extend their reach to all Arab countries.

‚Ä¢ We must continue with the resistance, as it, alongside the army and the people, prevented the enemy‚Äôs expansion into Lebanon.

‚Ä¢ Hezbollah is strong and recovering from its wounds; those who hoped for its end have been disappointed.

‚Ä¢ Our upcoming agenda includes implementing the agreement south of the Litani River, reconstruction efforts, and electing a president.

‚Ä¢ We hope for cooperation between Syria and Lebanon governments and people.

‚Ä¢ As part of our agenda, we advocate for positive dialogue on contentious issues, including: ""What is Lebanon‚Äôs position on the Israeli occupation of its land? How do we strengthen the Lebanese army? What is Lebanon‚Äôs defense strategy?""

‚Ä¢ We hope that the new ruling entity in Syria will regard ""Israel"" as an enemy.

‚Ä¢ The regime in Syria fell at the hands of new forces that we cannot judge until they stabilize, take clear positions, and regulate their situation.

‚Ä¢ Hezbollah has lost a military supply route in this phase, but this is a detail‚Äîwe can explore alternative routes.

‚Ä¢ It is essential to reassess after these significant developments in the region, and we hope the outcomes will be positive.",Text,True,alakhbar_english,None,[],[],117,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/1067,3934.0,12.0,No Replies

** 
__Ibrahim al-Amin, Al-Akhbar editor-in-chief 

__With the fall of the Baathist regime, it is crucial to acknowledge that the Syrian people aspire to choose political representation that reflects their own desires, not the expectations of external forces. This understanding could help shape the ongoing discussions about Syria‚Äôs future beyond its borders. Syrians' priorities often diverge significantly from those of external actors. While there may be overlap in priorities, the concerns of outsiders differ from what matters most to Syrians during this critical moment in their history.

The current Israeli invasion, with its sweeping air and naval strikes, decimated Syria‚Äôs remaining military capabilities in just two days‚Äîcapabilities that belong to the Syrian people, not solely to the Baath Party or Bashar al-Assad. This represented a calculated message from ""Israel"", the US, and Europe: Syria will not be allowed to rebuild a strong military, echoing the constraints imposed on Iraq following its invasion. For the majority of Syrians, the focus has shifted to navigating the aftermath of monumental change. They are focused on how these transformations will reshape their daily lives. They see‚Äîwhether we like it or not‚Äîthat the priority lies in shedding the burdens of the past. For some, the army itself is viewed as a source of hardship and oppression, making them less inclined to mourn the destruction wrought by Israeli aggression.

Conversations with various contacts in Syria, including those in the new leadership, suggest that while ""Israel‚Äôs"" aggression is acknowledged, it‚Äôs not a top priority. However, when questioning the new leadership about their response to the Israeli invasion, it is equally necessary to pose similar questions to those allied with the previous regime or the resistance. It is illogical to assume that no Syrian fighters, equipped and willing, exist to confront the Israeli forces, especially given the current opposition‚Äôs inability to seize full control. Yet, anyone placing the blame solely on the new leadership is also concealing the reality of their own shifting priorities.

We now face a new set of priorities and difficult questions as Syria grapples with profound structural economic shifts following its political transformation. The new rulers aim to establish a ""competitive environment,"" aspiring to emulate models like Lebanon, Turkey, and Dubai. Such a transition will undoubtedly bring challenges that extend beyond Syria‚Äôs borders, particularly impacting Lebanon and Jordan.

Meanwhile, we are left to take two steps: monitoring Syria's developments without interfering in its internal affairs, as we wouldn‚Äôt want Syria meddling in ours, and preparing for the political, security, and economic consequences of these changes. Those of us aligned with the resistance must work to strengthen anti-Israeli sentiment among Syrians, convincing them that true independence, lasting stability, and genuine prosperity cannot be achieved through a truce or reconciliation with the enemy. One must not forget how ""Israel"" itself, uncertain about the nature of Syria's future leadership, justifies its aggression by claiming it seeks to prevent military capabilities from falling into the ""wrong hands"".

What we're seeing now is WWIII--grand chessboard imperial redivision of the world system. But the imperialist powers do not have enough support at home for full mobilization, so they must do it through proxies, sanctions, and with stand off weapons. The Lebanon ceasefire didn't end anything, which was obvious from the beginning. The US with its allies (israel, turkkkey, NATO, arab states) is engaged in a push to win all objectives now in Europe and the Middle East. Lebanon/Hezbollah/Syria/Iraq/Yemen/Palestine will never be at peace until israel and amerikan imperialism are defeated. A ceasefire is only a pause. But not even that. The imperialists will calm down one field (Lebanon), but then attack another (Syria). The imperialists pretend to be acting independently but are in fact highly coordinated. Resistance forces that don't understand this and act accordingly will get tricked into diplomacy and half measures. They will get badly hurt, possibly defeated.

Still, there remains a lot of strategic depth and strength in the Axis of Resistance. In this context, popping off an event on the scale of the George Floyd uprising in the US/imperial core would be a MAJOR contribution to the AoF and anti-imperialist forces globally. ‚úä",Text,False,Not Available,None,[],['https://www.reuters.com/world/us-uae-discussed-lifting-assad-sanctions-exchange-break-with-iran-sources-say-2024-12-02/'],128,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/1022,2441.0,9.0,No Replies

transcript from voice over: In the long arc of the ancient people who inhabit this area, empires fall when their murderous behavior becomes too expensive. Our purpose now is to make this murder too expensive. Resistance is born in grief. Resistance is organized in tragedy. Resistance is bigger than this moment and this day. But it IS what becomes of us in the hardest hour. Resistance is not one man, one group or one plan. It is the energy conjured by all of us irrespective of our backgrounds, our nations, or our cause. The binary of hyperconsumeristic colonialism versus the humanitarian majority has been carved out clearly. Resistance is in how we experience trauma and tragedy and get up and demand freedom from tyranny more loudly than we did before. ‚ÄúYou are not defeated as long as you are resisting.‚Äù",Text,False,Not Available,None,[],[],56,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/995,2329.0,1.0,No Replies

**For those who resist the freedom to speak is not a privilege granted by a ruling class of slaveowners and genocidaires**. For us, there is only censorship and opprobrium from our class enemy, its state, and its settler lynch mobs. For us, the freedom to speak must be fought for, defended, and propagated in spite of the political violence imposed upon our movement - a movement for life and liberation from the death drive of imperialist world domination. In this way, **freedom of speech is better understood as the freedom to resist, a freedom that is not granted to us, but which we create in defiance of ruling class repression**. 

In the face of all this repression, at all costs we must continue to communicate, and we must do this while simultaneously increasing the reach of our ideas and **developing increasingly resilient systems and networks to avoid censorship**. This is in line with the common admonition to ‚Äúkeep talking about Palestine.‚Äù Our refusal to be silent about the Zionist genocide against the Palestinian people is what accounts for the longevity of the movement in the US thus far. But it is insufficient. **Going forward, not only must we talk about Palestine, we must also talk about imperialism, resistance and revolution**. In so doing, our resistance will grow stronger, but so too will the repression of the ruling class.

This came after [six activists drove a van](https://t.me/PalestineResist/51747) into Elbit Systems' research and manufacturing hub in Filton, Bristol in August, dismantling the zionist weapons and quadcopter drones. The action allegedly cost Elbit Systems over $1.3 million. Such direct action targeting Elbit, as well as its subsidiaries and [partners](https://t.me/PalestineResist/60427?single),  have [proven effective](https://t.me/PalestineResist/53330) in [shutting down](https://t.me/PalestineResist/65950) the transfer of weapons for these merchants of death. 

Following the Filton action, [10 people were arrested](https://palestineaction.org/prisoners/) and imprisoned, detained without charge and interrogated repeatedly. **__""I am in prison for trying to stop a genocide. My freedom is predicated upon the extermination of others.""__** Others, including the Teledyne 4, were imprisoned after actions targeting Barclay's and JP Morgan in Leeds due to their investment in Elbit Systems: **__""I have brought the intifada into the prison and the struggle continues. Free the prisoners. Free Palestine.""__**

**This week, the abduction campaign escalated, with 10 more people's homes raided and damaged in relation to the Filton action under the ""Terrorism Act,"" activists held without charge in typical zionist fashion. Raids continued for over a 24-hour period across the country under this sham act in protection of the zionist entity's interests. One of the detainees is reportedly held in solitary confinement for over 2 days, fed only 300 calories of food a day. Only one has been released so far, and another has begun an open-ended hunger strike**.**__ __**Protestors have been rallying outside the stations in the cold where actionists have been held for nearly 3 days without charge.

Among the raids was the residence of a 77-year-old woman by ""counter terrorism"" police; she was kicked out into the snow and expelled from her own residence for days. The mother and younger brother of one of the detainees were also handcuffed, despite lack of any accusations.

We stand firmly with the righteous actionists. This brutal repression expresses the depth of British collusion with the zionist genocide machine, but it also reveals the power of resistance and the cost of complicity. Each raid highlights the effectiveness of these actions in dismantling Elbit's role in Palestinian genocide. Every machine dismantled, every weapon disrupted, and every act of resistance brings liberation closer.

To those behind bars, to those on hunger strike, and to those defying the storm in all places: your courage ignites a movement that will not falter and will not be silenced.

However, the American government has historically stood as an obstacle preventing his release for decades. This obstacle remains as the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office expressed plans to appeal this decision, so now more than ever before is a critical stage in the campaign for his freedom. 

His liberation would mark a powerful turning point in the struggle of political prisoners worldwide and would bring hope to the thousands of revolutionary political prisoners awaiting their release. 

From Georges Abdallah and the Holy Land Five to Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu-Jamal and the Gilboa 6, the struggle to liberate all political prisoners must continue until they are all free from the shackles of colonialism as their freedom will inevitably lead to the complete liberation of Palestine, within our lifetime.

**Activist **[**Khalida Jarrar**](https://t.me/RNN_Prisoners/653)** faces a life-threatening campaign of systematic repression and abuse in solitary confinement.
**
For [more than 93 days](https://t.me/RNN_Prisoners/2401), the Palestinian fighter and prominent leader in the Popular Front, Khalida Jarrar, Umm Yafa, has been subjected to a systematic campaign of repression and abuse that threatens her life in the cells of the zionist occupation. She is facing harsh conditions in solitary confinement, and despite all this, she remains steadfast in confronting the policy of slow death.

Umm Yafa, who is considered one of the most prominent symbols of Palestinian resistance, lives in a small, poorly ventilated room lacking the most basic necessities of life, such as water and light, to the point that her detention room has become like a tomb.

According to her lawyer, the fighter Jarrar has no choice but to [lie next to the door to breathe the smallest amount of oxygen,](https://t.me/RNN_Prisoners/1960) in a tragic scene that reflects the brutality that Palestinian prisoners face.

The fighter Khalida Jarrar, who is 61 years old, is not an ordinary prisoner. She has endured a painful arrest experience that began in 2015, during which she was arrested four times before her most recent arrest in December 2023, her fifth. Throughout these years, the fighter has spent more than six years in the occupation prisons. During this time, she has carried a never-ending suffering, losing her mother in 2015, her father in 2018, and her daughter in 2021. The occupation did not even allow her to bid them farewell, in a clear war crime that represents a gross violation of human rights and international law.

Today, after 11 months since her most recent arrest, Umm Yafa is still being subjected to ongoing and failed attempts by the zionist prison administration to break her will. However, she remains steadfast, holding on to her national principles and her heroic resistance.

These desperate attempts by the occupation to target the morale of the prisoners will not succeed in breaking her resolve. Instead, they confirm her adherence to her people‚Äôs cause.

What fighter Khalida Jarrar is experiencing is part of a comprehensive campaign of abuse targeting Palestinian prisoners, particularly female prisoners, who face similar conditions in the occupation prisons. These repressive policies, led by the war criminal Ben Gvir, are failed attempts to subjugate the Palestinian people. However, the will of the Palestinian resistance and its living leadership will remain stronger than these brutal practices.

The Handala Center for Prisoners and Liberated Prisoners calls on the international community and humanitarian organizations to urgently intervene to save the life of fighter Khalida Jarrar and all prisoners in the occupation‚Äôs prisons, and to work to stop the repeated violations against them.

**The Center also calls on the masses of our people to escalate solidarity efforts with the prisoners on all levels and urges the free people of the world to organize global solidarity campaigns with Palestinian prisoners, especially with fighter Khalida Jarrar, and to continue the ongoing pressure on the occupation to stop these continuous violations and protect the rights of the prisoners.

**The statements of the White House ""that the occupation has taken measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza"" are blatant lies and a new American cover for genocide and the war of starvation against our people.
**
The Front affirms that the statements of the American White House, which claimed that ""'israel' has taken measures to address U.S. demands regarding the humanitarian situation in Gaza,"" are blatant lies aimed at covering up the ongoing crimes of the occupation against our people in Gaza.

These statements represent the insistence of the criminal U.S. administration to actively participate in the genocide and systematic war of starvation being waged against our steadfast people.

These U.S. statements are not new; since the 7th of October of last year until today, the U.S. administration has issued dozens of false statements, attempting to exonerate the occupation from the war crimes it is committing against civilians, while continuing to support the entity with internationally prohibited weapons and full political cover for its crimes.

These U.S. statements about the humanitarian situation contradict the testimonies of U.S. relief organizations themselves, which have confirmed that the occupation has not fulfilled its legal obligations to provide sufficient relief to civilians in Gaza, but rather obstructs the entry of humanitarian aid, leading to an increase in deaths and the suffering of civilians, and bringing the situation to the brink of famine for nearly 800,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The Front questioned: Why do these U.S. organizations not dare to hold the U.S. administration itself responsible for continuing the policy of starvation against our people, when they are able to accurately specify the zionist behavior?

The Front calls for the return of popular momentum in the U.S. street to pressure this criminal administration to stop supporting the crimes of the occupation and the war of starvation. It also calls on universities, trade unions, and all progressive groups to rise up once again against this U.S. support for the ongoing zionist crimes against our people.

We have to organize people where they are at, in the streets, around issues that impact their lives. We have to be able to create centers of people's power and control in the urban areas where we can access the electoral system and use it to our advantage. All politics is local, you see. So we're in a moment right now, as the genocide is proceeding in broad daylight, every day we pick up the news, we see 53 children and women slaughtered with American bombs and American military hardware.

But we need to understand that the trillions of dollars and millions of dollars the U.S. spends on its proxies never leave the United States. It goes to the corporations and the companies that manufacture the weapons of mass destruction in war. They go to the Boeings and McDonnell Douglas and they go to all of these corporate agencies.

And this is the working class. This is the class of technicians that underwrite and support and make the fascist nation-state possible. We have to understand the police are not workers, so why do they have a union? So that's a struggle right there. That's part of our mass line in the¬†united front, that the armed agents of the state are not workers. They kill workers when workers get out of line. They beat students when students protest against the policies of their schools and the policies of government. They enforce the policies of the white supremacist nation state.

And **the state is involved into what I call democratic fascism; the delusion of democracy**.

Why do African people who have been brought here as an act of war and declared slaves and chattel, why are we paying taxes when these crackers that started this country, this nation, said no taxation without representation. And Africans aren‚Äôt, Black folks are represented in the halls of Congress. They are not represented. AIPAC has more power in the Black community than the Black community has. The police unions exercise more power in urban governments in New York, in Chicago, in Los Angeles, in San Francisco, in Seattle than the people that live in those communities.

This is the militarized, corporate national security state.

So I just want to say to you, when you consider direct action, you have to consider: where to strike, who to strike, and how to strike, and it has to be attached to the needs and the requirements of a mass movement.¬†

We have to build a mass movement first. We have to be clear about our role domestically and clear about our connection to other oppressed people around the world and their struggle and how the U.S. empire uses proxies in order to suck the resources of the Third World and North Africa and use it for the benefit of the elites and the powerful here in this country.

**So you are in the belly of the beast so you have a unique opportunity to strike blows that nobody else can strike. And these blows have to constitute a monkey wrench.

We have to understand, we have to put a monkey wrench in the machinery of war, in the machinery of death and destruction that's dissolving our planet right before our eyes.**

**Censorship of Irish Republicans Will Fail** **- AIA**

In recent day, the national pages of Anti Imperialist Action Ireland on the US Multinational Social Media Corporation META owned platforms have been removed in a blatant act of censorship against the Revolutionary Irish  Socialist Republican Movement. 

The reasons given for the removal of AIA on Facebook and Instagram include ‚Äòsupporting dangerous individuals‚Äô which relates to our organising commemorations for Ireland‚Äôs Patriot Dead, something we are proud to do,  and for ‚Äòsupporting violence‚Äô which is connected to our open solidarity with the Palestinian National Resistance and our ongoing support for the fight for freedom in Ireland. 

The targeting of AIA online is part of a wider campaign targeting other Irish Republican and Palestinian solidarity organisations. The removal of AIA from META sites, coupled with the blackout of our activism in the main stream media is an attempt to silence the voice of Revolutionary Irish Republicanism. But the current campaign of censorship against AIA, like the campaigns to silence Republicans in the past will fail. 

It is no surprise that META has taken this action to support the interests of British Imperialism and Zionism following calls from members of the free state establishment including the ultra Zionist Alan Shatter in recent weeks for AIA to be censored. **The Free State and British imperialism in Ireland fear the growth of Revolutionary Irish Republicans and Militant Palestinian Solidarity in Ireland** and particularly the central role our organisation is playing in its development.

**A Call for Continued Global Mobilization to Stop the Zionist Aggression and Genocide War on Gaza**. 

As the zionist enemy continues its brutal massacres against our people in the northern Gaza Strip, and as ethnic cleansing operations persist against hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians amid siege, starvation, and complete isolation from the outside world,

We call upon the masses of our Palestinian people, the Arab and Islamic nations, and free people worldwide to take to the streets on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in all public squares and arenas. These marches and events are in support of our people, to condemn the genocide war, to pressure for an end to the aggression, and to protest the American and Western support for the horrific massacres against our people in Gaza.

**Press Statement on the Results of the U.S. Presidential Election**

In light of the results indicating Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the U.S. election, we, in the Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas, affirm the following:

1. Our position regarding the new U.S. administration will depend on its stances and practical actions towards our Palestinian people, their legitimate rights, and their just cause.

2. It is unfortunate to note that all successive U.S. administrations, since the occupation of Palestine in 1948, have held negative stances on the Palestinian cause. They have consistently been the primary supporter of the zionist occupation in all fields, and the previous administration followed a path biased towards occupation and aggression, providing political and military cover for zionist war criminals to continue some of the most horrific acts of genocide in modern history, solidifying its role as a full partner in the killing of tens of thousands of our people, including children, women, and the elderly.

3. We call for an end to the blind bias toward the zionist occupation and for serious and genuine efforts to stop the war of extermination and aggression against our Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank, to end the aggression against our brotherly Lebanese people, to halt the provision of military support and political cover for the zionist entity, and to recognize our people‚Äôs legitimate rights.

4. The elected U.S. President is urged to heed the voices that have risen from within American society itself for more than a year since the zionist aggression on Gaza, rejecting occupation and genocide and objecting to support and bias toward the zionist entity.

5. The new U.S. administration must understand that our Palestinian people will continue to confront the abhorrent zionist occupation and will not accept any path that detracts from their legitimate rights to freedom, independence, self-determination, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Al-Quds as its capital.

The Republican and Democratic parties are two identical faces in entrenching American tyranny and supporting zionism in the genocidal wars it waged against our Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and our nation.

America is the enemy of peoples; it is a symbol of tyranny and arrogance, ruling the world with iron and fire, igniting wars and the flames of hatred across the entire globe.

America, with all its components, parties, and councils, stands behind the support for the zionist entity with all kinds of shells, rockets, and destructive weapons that wreak havoc on our people in Palestine and Lebanon.

Our people rely solely on their steadfastness, the valor of their resistance, and the support of the Axis of Resistance and the free people of the nation and the world in confronting the genocide and massacres they are subjected to.

**Trump‚Äôs victory will reinforce the American anti-Palestinian approach, and the Democratic Party‚Äôs loss is a natural result of its direct involvement in the zionist war of genocide.**

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine affirms that Donald Trump and the Republican Party‚Äôs victory in the U.S. elections does not, in any way, signify a real change in the hostile approach that successive American administrations have pursued against our Palestinian people and their just cause. There is no fundamental difference between the Republican and Democratic parties; both have contributed to supporting the zionist entity and participated in the war of genocide against our people, whether through policies or unlimited military and diplomatic support.

**Our people have never placed their hopes on any candidate from either the Democratic or Republican parties, as we have never witnessed any positive change in U.S. administration policies, which have consistently aligned fully with the zionist entity, providing it with military funding and all forms of political, legal, and diplomatic protection.**

The Democratic Party‚Äôs loss is a logical result of its complicity with the zionist entity; it rejected calls from supporters of the Palestinian people, the Palestinian community, and Arab and Muslim communities in the United States to pressure for an end to the war of genocide in Gaza, continuing its support for aggression against our people. Today, the Democrats are paying the price for ignoring these demands at the ballot box.

**We in the Popular Front do not expect any positive development from a Donald Trump administration; rather, we anticipate an escalation in hostile policies against our people, fully biased in favor of the zionist entity.**

**We call on supporters of the Palestinian people, as well as movements, organizations, and groups that stand with our cause in the United States, to intensify pressure on the new U.S. administration to end its support for the zionist entity. 

We see in the popular and student movements that stand in solidarity with Gaza, along with the emergence of small, free voices and parties, a glimmer of hope that could contribute to even a slight change in the U.S. stance on our cause.**

**The Popular Front Calls for a Boycott of the Democratic and Republican Parties and Emphasizes the Need for Not Voting for Advocates of Genocide and Supporters of Colonialism**

**The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine calls on all the free people of America, especially supporters of the Palestinian people, Palestinian and Arab communities, as well as Black organizations and minority organizations, to boycott the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S. elections scheduled for tomorrow, as both share clear colonial objectives aimed at the genocide of our people and the reinforcement of the zionist settler project.**

Both parties have been directly involved in the ongoing war of genocide against our Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, never hiding their blatant bias in favor of the occupation and their continuous support for its racist policies that target the existence of the Palestinian people and uproot them from their land.

The stances of the two American parties reflect an explicit endorsement of ethnic cleansing, legitimizing zionist crimes and massacres against our people through [financial](https://t.me/PalestineResist/65448), [political](https://t.me/PalestineResist/66338), and [military](https://t.me/PalestineResist/66172) support for the zionist entity. Statements by leaders of these parties seek to beautify and justify their imperialist policies, using colonial rhetoric that views the Palestinian people as an obstacle to their so-called ""civilizational project,"" while their election campaigns overlook the heinous crimes committed daily against Palestinian civilians, especially women and children, in an attempt to mask the true face of the occupation and legitimize its crimes.

The Democratic and Republican parties continue their efforts to gain the support of zionist lobbies and influential powers, in pursuits aimed at reinforcing policies of mass displacement and systematic oppression against Palestinians.

In this context, the Popular Front renews its explicit call for all honorable individuals within American society not to vote for these two parties, which use American taxpayer money, drawn from the blood of the American people, to support the zionist genocide regime.

The Popular Front sees the boycott of these two zionist-aligned parties in tomorrow's U.S. elections as a moral stance no less significant than any other form of solidarity with the Palestinian people and the rights of oppressed peoples. It is also an effective means of exposing the falsity of American slogans that speak of freedom and human rights. The United States, through its political tools, seeks to exploit these concepts to justify its crimes and perpetuate its hegemony over nations, without regard for the rights of Palestinians who face the worst types of crimes.

Finally, the Front considers the boycott of the two parties a clear internal message to the U.S. administration and the international system surrounding it:** those who collude in the shedding of our people's blood and their displacement should not receive the votes of the world‚Äôs free people and our communities, who refuse to be complicit in their election or serve as silent witnesses to their criminal policies in power.**

On September 15, pigs in Brownsville opened fire on the L train over $2.90. The pigs shot three people over fare evasion. In the following weeks, pigs across the city brutalized and mass arrested anyone who protested against police terrorism. 

We've all seen the increase of pigs in our communities, the national guard at subway stations, private security firms such as Allied partnering with the MTA. We've seen the blueprints for a 300-ft. high jail in Chinatown. We've seen an increase in violent sweeps of both street vendors and our homeless neighbors. Now, we've seen the announcement of a $225 million dollar copy city in Queens set to break ground in 2026 in College Point. Its purported goal is to consolidate training for 18 city agencies, including the departments of sanitation, homeless services, and children's services. This facility aims to militarize city government workers against our most vulnerable neighbors and we are the ones paying for it to be built. 

This on top of the nypd's already-bloated budget, a record-breaking $12 Billion in 2025. This on top of the $22 Billion dollars the u.s. has sent to the zionist entity to fund its sadistic genocide in Gaza and its state terrorism in the West Bank, 48, Lebanon and Yemen. This on top of centuries of extraction to fund and pervade ever-expanding empire. Let this small act be a drop in a wave of abolitionist action.

**PB**: ""...We are policing ourselves with the ruling classes‚Äô distorted definitions of what is moral, and internalizing these definitions in the way we critique militant tactics that actually threaten power. If typical protests were actually protests, and not just non-confrontational, toothless rallies, then they would have a genuine role in the diversity of tactics needed to take down the empire from within, and militancy would play a role in them as well. As it stands, **sustained direct action has been the only thing forcing material concessions from the empire** ‚Ä¶ like [Cambridge](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/855) Elbit shutting down for good.‚Äù

**Alex**: So, what can people do? Where do you think people should people direct their energy?

**CW**: ‚Äú**Everyone can be escalating, or building capacity for escalation**. There are different roles for everyone ‚Äî organizing the masses, building the underground, making propaganda, going on the front lines, feeding the front liners.

**From the RICO and domestic terrorism charges against **[**Stop Cop City**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/867)** activists, to the **[**Uhuru 3**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/502)**‚Äôs free speech trial, to **[**Samidoun‚Äôs**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/797)** ‚Äòterrorist‚Äô designation, clearly we are entering a new phase of counterinsurgency, and it is more important than ever that the movement develops a strong counter-repression strategy**. Right now, that means studying up on historical counterinsurgencies like McCarthyism, COINTELPRO, the [Green Scare](https://crimethinc.com/2008/02/22/green-scared), and persecution of the [Holy Land Foundation Five](http://www.agrariansouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ASN-RB__Issue-19__Nov-Dec-2023.pdf) ‚Äî and also preparing tactically for more repression to come.‚Äù

**PB**: ‚ÄúActivists need to turn their attention away from mass orgs that counter the threat of state repression and infiltration by toning down their militancy and advocating for ‚Äòpeaceful,‚Äô reformist tactics. **We need to start seeing smaller groups of trusted peers, carrying out deliberate and precise strikes against imperial infrastructure**. It is far past the time for vague political education and outreach with no specific end, which many of these orgs make a top priority.

Political education efforts need to be reoriented towards understanding the legal mechanisms for state repression and the surveillance capabilities of the empire on revolutionaries. I love reading political theory, and it‚Äôs essential to have revolutionary theory guiding principled political organizations, but book clubs are not bringing people closer to taking the militant action needed to overthrow the fascist state. 

**We also need to stop appealing to the morality of the oppressors and seeking to mobilize people towards demanding radical change from some higher authority**. The people have the power, they just need to remember it.‚Äù

**CW**: ‚ÄúAbove all, **we need to believe we can win within our lifetimes**. I feel like there is historical amnesia about the [George Floyd Rebellion](https://illwill.com/print/how-it-might-should-be-done) four years ago, when 25 million people were in the streets, 300 cities/towns were on fire, Trump was in a bunker, and the feds were running out of tear gas and rubber bullets. **The 2020 uprising was a reminder of the spontaneous, militant, and revolutionary potential of the masses, that can only be organized and channeled into protracted struggle if we defeat the counterinsurgency attempting to neutralize and co-opt us**.

__
**Alex**: ‚ÄúSo what role do you think a typical protest versus something like sabotage should play in these movements? Do you see one as more effective than the other?‚Äù

**CW**: ‚ÄúIn any liberation struggle there is a time and place for mass rallies, for economic boycotts, for political education, for petty vandalism, for sabotage, for urban guerrilla warfare, for all of the above. **A diversity of tactics only works, though, if we are building our capacity to inflict material blows on our enemy and win the ultimate victory**.

Fanon said that **colonialism ‚Äòwill only yield when confronted with greater violence.‚Äô** Fanon‚Äôs statement is confirmed by the international failure of a year of mass rallies fetishizing ‚Äònon-violence‚Äô and cooperation with police. Around-the-clock rallies and days of action with no escalation have become a demobilizing force: they serve as a pressure release for people‚Äôs pent-up anger and energy, and then people go home, usually only having yelled at an empty building and listened to speeches saying what everyone there already knows and agrees with.

**I see a defeatist tendency coming from some people in the imperial core who think that we are exempt from taking part in the resistance, that people in the Global South should be doing all the dying, that the only thing we can do is passively voice our outrage and appeal to the non-existent morality of the oppressors**. We cannot afford to be defeatist, but we should look at what has worked and what hasn‚Äôt, be honest about our errors, and strategize how to correct these errors and escalate.‚Äù

**Alex**: ‚ÄúSo, what works?‚Äù

**CW**: ‚ÄúDirect action, community organizing, confrontation with the police, and secondary/tertiary targeting successfully shut down the first [Elbit](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/888) facility in the US in my hometown of [Cambridge](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/855), Massachusetts. Two of us are still facing charges there, but everyone else's charges have been dropped.

Through sabotage and property damage tactics, Palestine Action UK has permanently shut down several Elbit facilities and forced investors ‚Äì most recently [Barclays](https://t.me/PalestineResist/65950) ‚Äì to divest. **In **[**Atlanta**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/867)**, the united front against fascist state repression, the mass orgs‚Äô general non-disavowal of militants, the deepening of clandestine tendencies, and militants' continued attacks on police and surveillance infrastructure** appear to have kept organization from disintegrating there in the face of extreme counterinsurgency.

**And even if Cop City is built, the slogan of the movement there is, ‚ÄòIf you build it, we will burn it.‚Äô The struggle went far beyond the initial goal of shutting down a brick-and-mortar facility - **[**Stop Cop City**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/744)** can be understood as a framework for people's war against the police state. **Similarly, even if the university encampments did not win divestment, they did radicalize tens of thousands of people and give them frontline experience**. Each of these experiences have created new layers of militants and led to qualitative leaps in our long-term strategy**.‚Äù

**PB**: ‚Äú**The fact that there is a distinction at all between protest and sabotage is based on arbitrary conceptions of what is ‚Äòviolent‚Äô and ‚Äònon-violent**.‚Äô Typical protests are upheld as ‚Äònon-violent‚Äô and ‚Äòpeaceful,‚Äô while sabotage is ‚Äòviolent.‚Äô Property damage is not violence, and if it happens for the purpose of shutting down weapons companies, it is, in fact, peaceful. 

The state weaponizes claims of violence against all resistance, at home or abroad. We can see this in the way accusations of terrorism are levied against national liberation movements and those in solidarity with them, as well as the way spray painting a message on a building or even breaking a window is distorted as ‚Äòviolent‚Äô protest in the U.S.

**Ideally, there would be no distinction between protest and sabotage! ‚ÄòProtests‚Äô would not be the peace-policed, permitted parades as they are now, but legitimate moments of upheaval against the power of the state**.

**Alex**: ‚ÄúCritics often argue that direct actions like vandalism or property damage can alienate potential allies or harm a movement's credibility. What do you think of those critiques, especially in the context of your recent action?‚Äù

**CW**: ‚ÄúAnyone alienated by the dismantling of genocidal weapons factories is not someone I want to be in a movement with. **Anyone so scared about the liberal mainstream optics of militant resistance, whether in Palestine or here in the U.S., is going to be a friend of counterinsurgency**. 

We‚Äôve heard this argument against Palestine Action sabotage tactics in favor of organizing [Elbit](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/855) workers or appealing to their conscience‚Ä¶on the assumption that they have any conscience left. **Imperialist weapons company workers, regardless of their personal background, are enemies of the global working class and all colonized people**, and we do not have time to coddle their morality when they are enabling the slaughter of thousands of Palestinians every day. 

I certainly have my own critiques of our action and the early phase of [Palestine Action US](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/15) ‚Äî **I think the intentional/symbolic arrest tactic should be abandoned, a clear degree of separation between ‚Äúaboveground‚Äù and ‚Äúunderground‚Äù organizing needs to be made, and the movement must develop stronger digital and operational security to effectively go on the offensive**. But none of my critiques of Palestine Action US have to do with regretting our thrust towards militancy, escalation, and attacking the Zionist supply chain. Our action was to show solidarity with the people of Gaza in a material, not abstract, way ‚Äî not to appeal to weapons factory workers or to the New Hampshire masses.‚Äù

**PB**: ‚ÄúI think we need to worry less about alienating the movement and more about escalating resistance to fascism and imperialism here at home. The ideological split in the movement about tactics, in my view, is more about the aims of those on either side of the divide and less about the tactics per se. **What really differentiates these two conflicting tendencies is that one seeks to realize socialism in the imperial core, and rallies primarily about the injustices of capitalism and their effect on the American proletariat, and the other represents a staunch anti-imperialist position and seeks to open up a front of resistance against imperialism at home, in order to stand in actual solidarity with the national liberation struggles around the world that are casting off the yoke of the US empire** and bringing about a global revolution that frees everyone from capitalism, imperialism, and fascism. 

**People need to come to terms with the fact that fascism is, in fact, our material reality, and that any meaningful resistance to it will be met with significant political repression. The only way to dismantle a system like that is through militant resistance.** Any potential ally not willing to face that reality, and would instead critique tactics as alienating or harming one‚Äôs credibility, is not a real ally to the revolution. I understand that there is hesitance to engage in escalatory action in the face of state repression, but to be reduced to posturing about the morality or respectability of these tactics in general is only doing the state‚Äôs counterinsurgency for them.‚Äù",Text,False,Not Available,None,[],"['http://loloverruled.substack.com/p/uncompromising-inside-the-minds-of).', 'https://t.me/unity_of_fields/606).', 'https://t.me/unity_of_fields/855)', 'https://t.me/unity_of_fields/15)']",92,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/915,2395.0,32.0,No Replies

__A statement from the Bronx Anti-War Coalition to the US-Cuba Solidarity Movement__

The Bronx Anti-War Coalition asserts that true international solidarity demands unwavering support for Cuba and its allies against embargoes, blockades, and sanctions. US imperialism has targeted Cuba for over 60 years, yet Cuba has persisted due to its alliances and shared resistance with other anti-imperialist nations. Understanding this international solidarity is crucial for anyone involved in the Cuba solidarity movement.

Cuba's contributions to other nations, such as providing sugar and medical education opportunities, demonstrate its commitment to mutual aid. However, Cuba's survival is not solely due to its own efforts. Its alliances with other sanctioned countries like Syria, Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, ‚ÄúNorth Korea‚Äù), Venezuela, Nicaragua, China, Russia, Eritrea, and Zimbabwe are pivotal. These nations, despite diverse geographies, cultures and religions, unite in upholding self-determination and resisting external control, particularly from the United States and Western powers. They provide Cuba with essential material support, including food, medicine, and raw materials, forming lifelines that are crucial to Cuba‚Äôs endurance.

The Cuba solidarity movement in the US must recognize that attacking Cuba‚Äôs allies directly threatens these lifelines. It is inconsistent to criticize US policies on Cuba while supporting its stance on other adversaries. Aligning with US foreign policy places one on the wrong side of history, as Cuba is not the only target for regime change; this extends to other nations branded as adversaries by the US.

Furthermore, the rest of the nations on the U.S. list of State Sponsors of Terrorism, including Iran, the DPRK, and Syria, deserve defense and support. The call to remove Cuba from this list and lift its embargo must also extend to these countries. This broader demand reflects the true anti-imperialist position, rejecting selective support and acknowledging the importance of defending Cuba‚Äôs strongest allies. During the NYC rally for Cuba on October 27, Cuba-Palestine solidarity was highlighted, yet there was no mention of Iran, DPRK, and Syria, all anti-Zionist nations that also refuse to recognize the state of Israel. This omission underscores the need to challenge Western propaganda and align fully with the principles of international solidarity.

For the 32nd consecutive year, the UN General Assembly debated and voted overwhelmingly in favor of ending the US blockade against Cuba, with 187 countries supporting the resolution. This global consensus against US policies highlights the urgency of challenging the narratives and policies that seek to isolate and control sovereign nations.

We call upon all advocates of justice and peace to join us in this essential struggle. Recognizing the interconnectedness of Cuba‚Äôs alliances is vital to resisting imperialist agendas and fostering a multipolar world grounded in mutual respect and cooperation.


**We demand:

1: End the US embargo on and remove Cuba, Iran, DPRK, and Syria from the U.S. State Sponsors of Terrorism list to restore their ability to engage in free trade and international relations.

2: Support the alliances between Cuba and Iran, DPRK, Syria, Russia, China and other sanctioned nations by recognizing their shared struggle against imperialism and promoting mutual aid and cooperation.

3: Critically evaluate and oppose Western narratives that isolate sovereign nations, and educate the Cuba solidarity movement to highlight interconnected global struggles.**",MessageMediaPhoto,True,bxantiwar,None,[],['https://www.bronxantiwar.org/statements/cuba)'],145,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/905,2632.0,11.0,No Replies

His early childhood was partially categorized by Zionist crimes in the Nablus refugee camp between 2001 and 2004, particularly Operation Defensive Shield. On the other hand, it was characterized by steadfast resistance and adaptation to grief in the streets of the West Bank. The middle of three kids in his family, Ibrahim was fiercely principled throughout his adolescence and beloved in his community.

At the age of 15, al-Nabulsi turned to armed resistance. He quickly rose through the ranks, and became the commander of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, a militia associated with Fatah. He was known as ""the Lion of Nablus"" because of his participation in The Lions‚Äô Den, a resistance faction emerging directly out of Nablus. The Lions‚Äô Den is multi-factional, with members tied to Hamas, the PFLP, Fatah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The young men in the group view it as a step outside of the internal politics of these factions, and a step further into direct combat with the enemy.

The Zionist entity launched multiple operations with the intent of assassinating Ibrahim, such as Operation Breaking Dawn and Operation Break the Wave. Ibrahim continued to narrowly escape them, yet he always made defiant appearances at the funerals of his comrades. Ibrahim was martyred on August 9, 2022, when he was not yet 19 years old. Israel besieged and attacked the house he was inside of, injuring 40. Although Ibrahim made it out, refusing to surrender and defended by those with arms around him, he died in the hospital within hours. The Lion of Nablus went down fighting for his people, and passed alongside his two comrades Hussein Jamal Taha (16) and Islam Sabbouh (32). 

The martyrdom of Ibrahim al-Nabulsi inspired a deepening commitment to resistance, which was already gaining traction by the day in the West Bank. In the months following the assassination of al-Nabulsi by the Zionist entity, The Lions‚Äô Den claimed multiple victorious attacks on Israeli checkpoints, soldiers, and settlements, fighting with the heart of Ibrahim's memory and the goal of further mobilizing the Palestinian people to escalate resistance. His heart, his determination, and his steadfastness will eternally remain in the consciousness of the Palestinian people and their resistance.",Text,False,Not Available,None,[],[],103,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/903,2777.0,7.0,No Replies

Between each ‚Äúpivotal‚Äù election, life in the core ‚Äî but primarily in its internal and external peripheries ‚Äî only worsens, the settler state reinforces its tentacles with higher pig budgets and new massacring machines, and the noose of the climate apocalypse tightens around humanity‚Äôs neck. 

In the weeks leading up to the vote, the Holocaust Harris regime has been heightening state repression and threats of ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù charges against anti-imperialist, anti-zionist, anti-cop forces, as a warning for us not to escalate around the election when the ruling class is in constitutional crisis. Of course, **we understand this moment of ruling class weakness as a prime moment for revolutionaries, wherever they may be, to strike at the paper tiger and throw the empire into deeper contradiction and chaos**.

The illusion of ‚Äúchoice‚Äù in US elections is just that ‚Äî an illusion. The choice is not between a greater and lesser evil, ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù and ‚ÄúRepublican,‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal‚Äù and ‚Äúfascist‚Äù ‚Äî **the liberal and fascist wings of the empire, from QAnon to the Squad, are all proudly united in their goal to preserve the global hegemony of the US-zionist death machine**, the greatest evil this world has ever seen. Our real choice is between rejecting this political theater or falling for it, between acquiescence or resistance, between defeatism or revolutionary defeatism. **We choose revolutionary defeatism, which means turning the imperialist war into a civil war, or, in fewer words: BRING THE WAR HOME. 
**
No matter who wins this orchestrated political theater, our enemy ‚Äî the bloodsucking imperialist ruling class ‚Äî remains the same, and so does our resolve to resist them.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt revolutionary or materialist to disconnect things. To disconnect revolutionary consciousness from revolutionizing activity, to build consciousness with political agitation and educational issue-making alone is idealistic rather than materialist. The effect has been reformism rather than revolution. **When any election is held it will fortify rather than destroy the credibility of the power brokers. When we participate in this election to win, instead of disrupt, we‚Äôre lending to its credibility, and destroying our own**. With all the factors of control over the electoral process in the hands of the minority ruling class, the people‚Äôs party can always be made to seem isolated, unimportant, even extraneous.

This follows a direct action campaign targeting the bank 54 times in one year, including a nationwide action against nearly 20 Barclays sites in a day.

[**Palestine Action UK**](https://palestineaction.org/barclays-divest-elbit/) said: We vowed to cost [Barclays](https://x.com/Pal_action/status/1851955898123419748) more than they gain by investing in Israel's weapons trade ‚Äî and we did. **To win, we need to hit complicit institutions where it hurts**. To them, their balance sheet is all that matters...

Palestine Action‚Äôs 11-month long campaign against Barclays reached its peak on 10th June 2024, when 20 branches had their windows smashed, drenched in red paint, in a co-ordinated nationwide overnight action with Shut the System. Four days after, Barclays CEO CS Venkatakrishnan penned in the Guardian that the bank is concerned about ‚Äúoverall suffering‚Äù in the region, and is very accepting of the type of ‚Äúpeaceful protest‚Äù seen in multiple years of campaigning up until this year. But, in a media campaign co-ordinated with former Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, Venkatakrishnan complained of Palestine Action‚Äôs disruptive actions against the bank.

**Inadvertently, Barclays CEO affirmed Palestine Action‚Äôs strategy, which is to make the cost of dealing in genocide, occupation, and apartheid exceed the potential to profit from it**. Throughout this year-long campaign, several activists were arrested. During questioning, police claimed that many actions caused damage between ¬£250k to ¬£500k in value. **Most actions forced bank branches to close for weeks at a time, contributing to the financial disruption to the bank...
**
Through a focused strategy, direct action has achieved multiple successes and forced the hands of many complicit institutions. We will remain committed and focused to the task at hand and target any and all institutions and businesses which enable Israel‚Äôs biggest weapons firm to mantain their genocidal operations. That means, **if Barclays does reinvest into Elbit Systems in the future, Palestine Action will come knocking again**...

$17.9 billion was sent directly to the entity, while the rest was for ""regional defense.""

**According to the report, 70% of ""israeli"" military spending on the current war came from the US Treasury.** This is money from American taxpayers which was used to spend on domestic goods and healthcare for settlers, which is a unique exception the US grants to no other country.

Framing Samidoun's activities in support of Palestinian prisoners for the last 13 years ""terrorism"" is part of an increasingly aggressive stance that seeks to criminalize Palestinian solidarity, undermine grassroots mobilization, and obscure the injustices and genocide faced by the Palestinian and Arab peoples, especially prisoners.

His attorneys have also repeatedly warned the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) of the very risks which caused Leonard‚Äôs hospitalization, but have been ignored. As USP Coleman I can not appropriately address Leonard‚Äôs medical needs, Leonard should be transferred to a medical facility equipped to meet his medical needs.

**In times of intensified repression, clandestine publishing becomes a necessity and a vital form of intellectual and political survival**. As censorship tightens, we must draw from history, learn from past movements, and rely on one another to **keep the flame of resistance burning**. This is not a call to abandon the academic space entirely, but to **master the art of navigating both worlds** ‚Äì‚Äî maintaining our presence within institutional frameworks while never losing sight of the collective struggle. **To go underground** as academics means to learn from the endurance of Palestinian resistance, the steadfastness of Gaza, and the struggle of Palestinian prisoners. It is a call to learn rather than teach, to apply knowledge rather than extract it. 

**The tunnels dug by Palestinian prisoners with spoons, and those created by Gaza's resistance, symbolize a reorientation of our approach** ‚Äî teaching us to think not just laterally but vertically, **subverting spatial barriers and borders**. These tunnels remind us to delve into our collective history of knowledge production, to republish what has been buried or scattered in lost archives, and to make accessible what's been withheld by institutional gatekeepers. Doing so teaches us to **reject the Western capitalist drive for constant novelty, which seeks to erase the wisdom of militant generations before us**. The words of those who were often assassinated for their ideas remain alive.

To learn from Palestinian resistance is to carve and dig escape tunnels from academia's mental production lines, with pens as our tools. **We go underground not to bury our heads and remain hidden but to traverse and dismantle the borders that confine us**. We go underground to emerge stronger, **to speak loudly and radically in spaces where our voices are suppressed**, and to break through the boundaries that seek to silence us.""

In the midst of this, we publish a timely [intervention](http://unityoffields.org/no-peace) titled ‚Äú**NO PEACE: Reflections on Columbia, The Student Intifada and the Culture of Counterinsurgency**.‚Äù

Written and anonymously submitted by a partisan of Hind‚Äôs Hall‚Äîthe building occupation that shook Columbia University‚Äîthis essay offers useful reflections on what it will take for our movement to effectively escalate and bring the war home: 

‚ÄúIf **the radical flank of the Student Intifada** is to advance to the level of struggle that is necessary to win, there will need to be a profound shift in our cultural values and how those values relate to our strategy and tactics. In other words, **a cultural revolution is in order, and the changes that are required of us will throw a wrench in the gears of our own subjectivity**. If our demand is that the universities divest from the US empire, then we must also divest from the lies that they¬†sell us....

**The reality of the matter is that we are engaged in class struggle against the most powerful empire in human history**...

The demand of divestment was not the sole motivating force of the action¬†‚Äî our vision and strategy were more expansive than this. Hind‚Äôs Hall was an attempt to move outside the bounds of listing demands and into a terrain of direct confrontation with the state committing a holocaust ‚Äî one of many in Amerika‚Äôs sordid history. **The radical faction wanted to raise the ceiling of militancy in the movement as a whole and reveal to the world that the question of Palestinian national liberation had brought the reality of anti-imperialist class war to the heart of the metropole**.""

[**Atlanta Solidarity Fund**](https://x.com/ATLSolFund/status/1849515391866769698): Today all charges are dismissed (or about to be dropped pending pretrial intervention) for 7 activists facing felony charges related to a Cop City protest in 2022. **The state knows there was never a legitimate case to begin with. These charges were simply used to terrorize the public out of opposing the police's political agenda**.

The protesters faced years in jail for allegedly marching through a construction site on Georgia State University campus to protest Brasfield and Gorrie, the Cop City construction contractor. Less than a week before trial was set to begin, the prosecutor dropped all charges.

**This is not the first dismissal of bogus charges against Cop City protesters, and it won't be the last. With each new development the picture becomes more clear: There has been a coordinated campaign over the past two years by police and prosecutors to suppress protest in Atlanta**.

We exist to ensure that all protesters, including these eight, have the support they need to defend themselves against political prosecution. If you are a protester facing repression, get in touch! If you aren't, [**support our work**](http://atlsolidarity.org/) and spread the word! We protect us.

**Newly revealed **[**bodycam footage**](https://x.com/ATLSolFund/status/1849604536052351069)** also** **shows Atlanta Police higher-ups conspiring to fabricate felony charges against protesters because they were part of a group which opposed Cop City.
**
In the video, GSU police say there's no basis for felony charges for 8 people who protested at a construction site. An APD Major pressures officers to come up with anything at all to charge them with, to help APD crack down on ""this group"" - meaning the Stop Cop City movement.

The protesters were subsequently charged with felony burglary, jailed for almost a week, and fought the case for 2 years. The prosecutor dropped all charges days before trial. It could not be more clear: **APD is manipulating the criminal legal system to silence its critics**.

""The movement to Stop Cop Nation stands in solidarity with Samidoun.

On the week of the 29th National Day of Action Against Police Brutality, we declare that the struggle to Stop Cop Nation and the struggle to Free Palestine are one and the same.

The movement to Stop Cop Nation sees the recent sanctioning of Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network as a ""terrorist entity"" by the U.S. and Canada as an attack on our entire movement. We express our unwavering solidarity with Samidoun in the face of this state repression.

**The United States has historically used accusations of terrorism and conspiracy to repress movements, from the Red Scare to COINTELPRO to the persecution of the Panther 21 and the Black Liberation Army.

Over the decades, countless freedom fighters have been exiled, murdered, or made political prisoners by our government. We need not look further than Assata Shakur's presence on the FBI's most wanted list, the criminalization of the Holy Land Foundation, the RICO charges in Atlanta, and the conspiracy charges against the Uhuru 3 to see that this method of repression has been both continuous and escalating.**

Just as Cop Cities are inspired by the ""Little Gaza"" training facility in Israel, so too is Cop Nation - **the militarization and expansion of the Amerikkkan police state **- being constructed from the blueprint of the zionist entity.

Just as Samidoun is being targeted for their unflinching support of the Palestinian resistance - the beating heart of the international anti-imperialist struggle - and their insistence that all Palestinian prisoners are political prisoners, Atlantans are being baselessly targeted because of the state's complete failure to break the resolve of the militant insurgency driving the anti-police movement in the imperial core.

It is specifically in these moments of harsh repression that silent abandonment and retreat weakens our movement and makes the terrain more dangerous for everyone. If we do not form a united front in the face of this repression, we will be defeated one by one.

The ‚Äúterror‚Äù sanctions against Samidoun are absurd and we condemn them in the strongest terms. But **they are also an opportunity for us**; an opportunity for us to declare our unwavering support for our comrades, an opportunity for us to test the strength of our convictions, and an opportunity for us to prove again and again each time such repression occurs that **the movements to Free Palestine and Stop Cop Nation are totally and absolutely inseparable**.

**We call on all organizations to publicly announce their solidarity with Samidoun and with all others currently facing the brunt of state repression**.""

These designations follow a previous ban in Germany and the labeling of Samidoun as a ‚Äúterrorist organization‚Äù by Israel. The U.S. [claims](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2646) Samidoun is a ‚Äúsham fundraiser whose efforts have supported terrorism‚Äù by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Marxist-Leninist Palestinian political party also labeled as a ‚ÄúForeign Terrorist Organization‚Äù by the U.S. **For its part, Samidoun **[**states**](https://samidoun.net/2024/10/we-keep-resisting-us-and-canada-sanction-samidoun/)** it ‚Äúdoes not have any material or organizational ties to entities listed on the terrorist lists of the United States, Canada or the European Union.‚Äù**

**One may disagree with Samidoun and Unity of Fields on their specific political positions, but the entire movement against the ongoing war and genocide in Gaza should be concerned with the state‚Äôs move to target them. In no way can Samidoun be understood as a ‚Äúsham charity‚Äù or ‚Äúterrorist entity,‚Äù nor a media project like Unity of Fields as responsible for ‚Äúdomestic terrorism.‚Äù Even if one were to accept the legitimacy of power to deploy a subjective term such as ‚Äúterrorism,‚Äù in reality, the extent of Samidoun‚Äôs work is posting statements, organizing public educational and political events, and pushing online action campaigns, while Unity of Fields maintains a counter-info website and social media accounts.**

As a member of Samidoun [stated in a recent interview](https://truthout.org/articles/palestinian-prisoner-solidarity-activists-face-sanctions-and-deportation/), ‚ÄúThey are attacking us on the basis that we were fundraising for other political groups and political parties and they know very well that this is not true.

unity_of_fields,855,unity_of_fields,unity_of_fields,2024-10-23 15:30:01,"üîª**Article**: [**How the Cambridge Community Evicted Elbit: An Interview with BDS Boston**](https://www.thecrimeson.com/article/bds-boston-interview)

**Can you describe the trajectory of the campaign to get Elbit out of Cambridge? When did it start, how did the tactics change over time, and what is the state of the campaign now?**

**BDSB**: Our struggle to remove Elbit Systems from 130 Bishop Allen Drive in Cambridge began in spring 2023. We started out with a lot of canvassing. We approached canvassing with openness and curiosity, asking local community members how they felt about Elbit‚Äôs presence in the city and if/how they felt our fight to remove Elbit fit into their needs and priorities. One of our favorite questions to ask community members was: ‚ÄúWhen we remove Elbit from the 2nd floor of 130 Bishop Allen Drive, what do you think that space should be used for instead?‚Äù Pretty much everyone had something to say in response to this question. Younger folks in particular lit up when we asked it.

Then, following Hamas‚Äôs military operation on October 7th, 2023, and the escalated Israeli military campaign in Gaza that followed, Elbit‚Äôs Cambridge facility **became the site of frequent escalated direct actions by anonymous community members. For over a month, outside surfaces of the building remained covered in red paint that the landlord apparently found difficult to fully remove. These direct actions quickly led to increased police presence around the building. On one occasion in late November 2023, Cambridge Police positioned a sniper on the roof of a building across the street from 130 Bishop Allen Drive. If the goal of this increased policing was to secure Elbit‚Äôs position in the community, it backfired. Community members were outraged by CPD‚Äôs deployment of a sniper on a building above a street heavily foot-trafficked by residents, all to protect a weapons company**. Elbit‚Äôs co-tenants in the building felt as though they had become a buffer between Elbit, the police, and an increasingly angry and vocal public ‚Äî certainly not what they signed up for when they decided to rent space in the building.

In the winter and spring of 2024, BDS Boston turned up the pressure, initiating what became weekly demonstrations outside Elbit‚Äôs Cambridge facility, complemented by weekend actions targeting the collaborators responsible for sustaining Elbit‚Äôs local and global operations. The disruptive character of weekday protests often forced Elbit and their co-tenants to work from home. Weekend protests routinely forced branches of Elbit investor Chase Bank to close down for the day. One weekend [**protest**](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/6/30/pro-palestine-rally-peter-palandjian/) brought 100 community members to the North Cambridge home of Peter Palandjian, CEO of Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation, Elbit‚Äôs landlord in Cambridge.

In the summer of 2024, inspired by the militancy of recent student encampments, BDS Boston turned the pressure up another notch through a ‚ÄúWeek of Action.‚Äù Our Week of Action featured daily disruptions of Elbit and its local collaborators, including one 18 hour long picket and vigil in front of Elbit‚Äôs Cambridge facility. By this point, Elbit‚Äôs continued tenancy at 130 Bishop Allen Drive had simply become untenable.

unity_of_fields,845,unity_of_fields,unity_of_fields,2024-10-22 04:14:17,"**Black Alliance for Peace** [**statement**](https://blackallianceforpeace.com/bapstatements/samidoun)**: Resistance to Oppression is a Human Right**

The Black Alliance for Peace (BAP) recognizes that we are in a moment of increased and increasingly dangerous political repression. **Peoples‚Äô resistance to oppressive, militaristic, and genocidal policies enacted by the U.S. national security apparatus are once again being met with persecution, marginalization, violence, and even lawfare. The latest example being the sanctioning of Samidoun, **an organization advocating on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, as an operation supporting a group that the U.S. state designated as a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù organization. 

**BAP is not interested in debating the merits of these charges because the weight of evidence on state actions suggests that the state bears the responsibility to prove that it is not engaged in another crude effort to smash all opposition to zionist settler colonial fascism**. Having lost the narrative on its support for the zionist apartheid state and bogged down in another militaristic adventure in Ukraine, we see an almost desperate attempt by the U.S. political elite (and its Western minions) to crush dissent. It is using a variety of tools: federal and local police, the propaganda apparatus in the form of the corporate media, and the legal system.

Just in the last year, this **infrastructure of repression** has been weaponized against independent media such as African Stream, which was deplatformed from Meta, Google, and TikTok after U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken claimed, without evidence, that the site is controlled by Russia. Radio Sputnik was also forced to end its programming, and the U.S. **FBI convicted the ‚ÄúUhuru 3‚Äù** ‚Äì Omali Yeshitela, Penny Hess & Jesse Nevil ‚Äì on conspiracy charges. Meanwhile, the violent crackdown of pro-Palestine/anti-genocide student protests across college campuses continues. 

**The punishment of those who openly oppose U.S. government policies, particularly in opposition to U.S. support of zionist occupation and genocide, is in full swing as the state and its foreign state agents, like AIPAC and the ADL, move to designate organizations, entities, or individuals that support Palestinian resistance as ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù or supporters of ‚Äúterrorism.‚Äù** The objective of this repression is not just to silence political opposition, but to criminalize it ‚Äì totalitarianism in practice.  

We in the Black Alliance for Peace fully understand the dangerous times we are in. Yet, we remain unyieldingly committed to our principles, to People(s)-Centered Human Rights, to people‚Äôs liberation struggles, and to the right of all individuals and people to resist colonialism, dictatorship, global imperialist warmongering, and all forms of oppression. For BAP, ‚Äú**No Compromise, No Retreat**!‚Äù is more than a slogan. Ultimately, it is our response to the deepening repression; and it is an affirmation of the ongoing struggle that must be waged in order to finally defeat the dark forces of oppression and build a new world.

View on website: unityoffields.org/theyre-scared

__18 October 2024__ ‚Äì **On 17 October 2024, US Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) **[**published**](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/rubio-urges-domestic-terrorism-investigation-of-pro-hamas-group/)** a letter to US Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to ‚Äúopen a domestic terrorism investigation into Unity of Fields and utilize all resources available to hold this group accountable under the law,‚Äù citing Unity of Fields‚Äô ‚Äúbelief that the ‚Äòrevolution will come within our lifetimes‚Äô as they ‚Äòwill make sure of it,‚Äô‚Äù and our **[**reading list**](https://unityoffields.org/reading-resource-lists/)** of ‚Äúrevolutionary material‚Äù including Mao, Basel Al-Araj, and the US Army Counterinsurgency Manual.
**
Unity of Fields is an anti-imperialist propaganda front ‚Äî a media project that shares reporting and analysis on actions taken in resistance to the murderous ruling class of the United States, and the repression faced by those who resist. **Unity of Fields is not Palestine Action US or any sort of direct action group ‚Äî we don‚Äôt do actions, we only report on them and receive anonymous submissions. **

Rubio is a mere mouthpiece for the ruling class, and this ventriloquist act of using politicians as dummies to relay threats is but one way the ruling class works to intimidate people of conscience into silence. It is an attack that exposes the lie of their vaunted ‚ÄúFreedom of Speech,‚Äù an explicit threat against journalism, speech, and ideas.

**Unity of Fields has existed for less than 2 months, and clearly, the attack we are already facing is a testament to the power of our propaganda and the fear it strikes in the hearts of the imperialist ruling class**. They are cowards dripping in blood with lies pouring from their mouths, and we will not let them silence us. Their desperate and baseless accusations betray valuable information about what they fear most: a unified front of resistance against the US-zionist death machine, and the censorship-resistant propagation of these ideas.

This week alone, we saw the fascist counterinsurgency‚Äôs phony ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù [**designation**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/810) of the Samidoun Palestinian Political Prisoner Solidarity Network, more [**raids**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/810) and detainments of anti-zionist journalists, and the [**martyrdom**](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/810) of Palestinian resistance leader Yahya Sinwar. Now it is more important than ever that the anti-imperialist movement refuses to back down from pro-resistance speech and vocal solidarity with those facing the brunt of state repression.

by Unity of Fields
**Full article**: unityoffields.org/counter-repression

This week, the fascist counterinsurgency against the international anti-imperialist, anti-zionist movement escalated to a new phase. It is more important than ever that this movement prepares for a strong counter-repression strategy and studies up on ongoing and historical counterinsurgencies.¬†

In recent days and months, the imperialist ruling class has [designated](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803) Samidoun Palestinian Political Prisoner Solidarity Network as a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù entity, [threatened](http://unityoffields.org/theyre-scared) Unity of Fields with a ""domestic terrorism"" investigation, [raided](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803) the house of Electronic Intifada journalist Asa Winstanley in the UK, detained other journalists including [Richard Medhurst](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803), [Richard Lofreddo](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803), and [Scott Ritter](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803), [restricted](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803) the üîª emoji and the word ‚Äú[zionist](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803)‚Äù on Meta, [banned](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/803) Resistance News Network in the EU, [martyred](https://t.me/unity_of_fields/808) Palestinian resistance leader Yahya Sinwar, and more.

**The purpose of all this repression is to scare us, to intimidate us, to break our souls and crush our spirits. The imperialist ruling class is cracking down on our movement because we are strong, because we outnumber them, because they are paper tigers.**

Let repression breed more resistance!

**Announcement of the Martyrdom of the Mujahid Leader and Great National Symbol Yahya Al-Sinwar ""Abu Ibrahim,"" Commander of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle**

""Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah. Some of them have fulfilled their vow, and some are still waiting, and they have not changed in the least.""

With all the pride, dignity, and honor, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, mourns to our Palestinian people, to our entire nation, and to the free people of the world, one of the noblest and bravest men, a man who dedicated his life for Palestine and gave his soul for the sake of Allah on the path to its liberation. He was true to Allah, and Allah was true to him, choosing him as a martyr alongside his fellow martyrs:

**We mourn the great national leader, the Mujahid Martyr Brother Yahya Al-Sinwar (Abu Ibrahim)**, **Head of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Commander of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle**

He rose as a heroic martyr, advancing and never retreating, wielding his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the frontlines. He moved between all combat positions, steadfast and stationed on the honored land of Gaza, defending the land of Palestine and its holy sites, inspiring the spirit of endurance, patience, steadfastness, and resistance.

Our great people, our Arab and Islamic nations, and the free people of the world:

The martyred leader Yahya Al-Sinwar lived as a mujahid, and from his youth, he carved his path within the ranks of Hamas, engaging in its resistance operations. During 23 years of imprisonment, [he triumphed over the zionist jailer.](https://t.me/PalestineResist/286) After his release in the [Wafa al-Ahrar deal,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/9470) he continued his contributions, planning and fighting until his eyes witnessed, on October 7, 2023, [the day of the great flood](https://t.me/PalestineResist/13228) that shook the depths of the entity, exposing the fragility of its supposed security. The heroic epics of our people and the valor of our victorious resistance followed, until he attained the highest rank and the noblest medal, ascending as a witness and a martyr, content with the jihad and sacrifice he offered.

The martyr leader Yahya Al-Sinwar followed in the footsteps of great martyred leaders, including the founding martyr [Sheikh Ahmed Yassin,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/24405) [Dr. Abdelaziz Al-Rantisi,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/6825) Al-Maqadmeh, Abu Shanab, Jamal Mansour, Jamal Saleem, [the martyred leader Ismail Haniyeh,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/51032) and his deputy [Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/42038) along with the caravan of martyrs from all our leaders and people. We affirm that these sacrifices will continue to illuminate our path and drive us to more resilience and steadfastness. Hamas remains committed to the promise of its founding leaders and martyrs until the aspirations of our people are fully realized: the complete liberation and return, and the establishment of the Palestinian state on the entire national soil with Al-Quds as its capital, by Allah‚Äôs will. This will become a curse upon the invading occupiers who are strangers to this land.

Our great people, our Arab and Islamic nations, and the free people of the world:

We‚Äôve got to fight to get resistance organizations off the list, but we‚Äôve got to fight to bring down these structures altogether because the only reason they exist is to extend imperial power. They don‚Äôt exist for any other reason. They exist to destroy our movements.

unityoffields.org/we-are-all-samidoun

On 15 October 2024, the US baselessly designated the [**Samidoun Palestinian Political Prisoner Solidarity Network**](https://samidoun.net/) (Samidoun) as a Specially Designated National (SDN) by summarily adding it to the Treasury Department‚Äôs list of sanctioned organizations and individuals. At the same time, Canada designated Samidoun as a ‚Äúterrorist entity‚Äù under Canada‚Äôs Criminal Code. Samidoun, a longtime target of state repression and liberal zionist counterinsurgency from within the movement, is a principled and unyielding international voice for thousands of Palestinian political prisoners. **We categorically reject this illegitimate ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù designation, and we call for international progressive forces to stand with Samidoun.
**
Imperialists have always weaponized ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù labels to delegitimize liberation movements, but the designation of Samidoun, an unarmed solidarity movement, is a qualitative escalation. Whether it is Cuba being designated as a ‚Äústate sponsor of terrorism,‚Äù Stop Cop City protestors facing domestic terrorism charges, or material support to terrorism (MST) charges being weaponized against anti-zionists, these terror lists and designations must be totally rejected and abolished. The US, Canada, and the zionist entity are the real ‚Äúterrorists,‚Äù the genocidal settler states built on mountains of corpses and rivers of blood, at this very moment burning Palestinians alive in hospital tents, and slandering as ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù those who dare to resist them. 

As the US-backed zionist genocide intensifies in Palestine and Lebanon, the counterinsurgency intensifying against the anti-imperialist movement is no surprise. Make no mistake, fascism is already here. This attack on Samidoun is an attack on the entire anti-imperialist movement, and marks the beginning of a wave of broader criminalization and repression of pro-resistance speech, weaponizing laws like MST and RICO to break solidarity. Anti-imperialist forces must rigorously adapt our strategies to this new phase of repression. **It is more crucial than ever to voice support for the resistance because the more of us that do, the harder it is for the state to divide and disorganize us**. By cowering now, by withholding critical solidarity, by allowing the state to isolate organizations through lawfare and phony ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù designations, we only relinquish our collective power.

But if they fail, if our message continues thru the persistence of militants and through the regeneration of the movement with the entry of new participants, the enemy stands exposed and the opposite lessons are learned: that resistance is possible, making victory imaginable. It is for this reason that it is critically important to strain our resources to uncompromisingly increase resistance speech during and in the wake of discrete instances of repression, exposing the enemy and demonstrating our commitment and steadfastness in the struggle__."" Do not let this attack stop you from speaking the truth. This is all that Samidoun has done, expressing political solidarity w/ a liberation movement actively resisting US imperialism & Zionism. Fear is normal, but to give in to it is to submit to the terror of monsters. The people leading this attack are directly responsible for the genocide in Gaza. They are the criminals and they will face justice. We can make sure of it. But we must remain steadfast, stand on our principles, and refuse to back down. This is the ONLY defense we have. If we shrink from the task they will come for others and each time we will meet it weaker and more disorganized.

We condemn the CUNY administration, the Brooklyn College administration, and the kkkillers of the NYPD, for their complacency in the genocide of the people of the nation of Palestine and the destruction of Lebanon and Yemen, and for their oppression and destruction of the New York City community.

We demand the end of the BC Study in Occupied Palestine Program that sends ripe new settlers and hopeful IOF reservists to learn in Haifa, Al Naqab (""Negev""), Yaffa (""Tel Aviv""), and Al Quds (""East Jerusalem"") while the zionist entity has destroyed every last university in Gaza.

We demand cops OFF of Brooklyn College's campus.

We demand that tuition be made FREE once again.

The UPenn run campus known as Pennovation in the Grays Ferry neighborhood where Ghost Robotics has its offices was coated with a mix of red paint, broken glass, nails, and messages from Philadelphians to Ghost Robotics and their landlord and backer UPenn: no business as usual for evil fucks who make murder tech!

...

As we cross the threshold of one year since the people of Palestine took a bulldozer through the apartheid wall, we must reflect on how far we have come, and how far we still have to go to see the liberation of Palestine and the liberation of all people from colonialism, militarism and imperialism. This last year of resistance to apartheid and genocide has mobilized millions, and support for the people of Palestine is stronger than ever before. Even still, the US and Israeli backed assault on the Levant carries on, with escalations in the West Bank, Lebanon, and Iran, and doctors estimating that 200,000 people have been killed. If the US government won't stop sending weapons to Israel, we hope people will do what they can to stop the weapons themselves.

So long as Ghost Robotics exists and until Palestine is free, people in Philly and around the world will continue to fight against agents of genocide.¬†Revolution until Liberation. Free Free Palestine!¬†

[__Excerpts__]

With this article, we articulate five direct lessons for the student movement and broader mass movement in amerika, bestowed on us through the militancy and struggle represented by Operation Al-Aqsa Flood: 

**1. Escalation is the path to change**: We must assess the failure of the student intifada, and the broader movement. We must take to heart the call of the students in Gaza to begin ""a new revolutionary phase of comprehensive escalation."" Statements from Gazan students require us to reflect on the line between reform and militancy. We have a particular duty, as students in the imperial core, to not bend at the knees of opportunist politicians and movements, and to hold the line on truly revolutionary politics.

**2. Our vision must extend beyond what the enemy imposes on us**: It is clear that with these efforts from our enemies, we must intensify our struggle against the mindset instilled by the universities. We must go look beyond our lives as students and partake in struggles in our broader communities. The student movement can only be successful should it link and subordinate itself to the broader revolutionary struggle.

**3. The revolutionary cause is a self-sacrificing and optimistic one**: We reject the tendency in the pro-Palestinian movement to avoid risks, to be overly pessimistic, and to cower in the face of repression. Assurance of victory should not be a prerequisite to struggle. Our enemy is stronger than us, but the Al-Aqsa Flood taught us that the myth of their infallibility can be shattered. 

**4. Strategy is necessary to continue escalating**: We put forward the correct conception that escalation and organization form a contradiction. What does this mean? It means that escalation is only possible through mass work, outreach and sometimes grueling efforts to mobilize masses of people, and that escalation in turn develops those who have been organized and brings us closer to the goal of stopping this country's support for genocide.

**5. We must draw a line of demarcation**: What is a line of demarcation? It is making it clear who are our (potential) allies, and who are our enemies. A figurative line that distinguishes us from those who oppose us. It is taking action against our enemies and taking action to build and care for our movement.

On the night of October 2, three groups engaged in a coordinated attack against Flock Safety license plate readers/surveillance cameras in the Atlanta Metro Area. This action was inspired by the communique ‚ÄúFrom A Matter Of Principle To A Matter Of Tactics‚Äù posted to Scenes on July 27, 2024, to develop the tactical muscle of coordinated attacks as force multiplier. The city was divided into four quadrants, with each group selecting a quadrant. 23 cameras were disabled in total.

13 cameras were completely destroyed using various methods. Several were cut from poles and destroyed, either after the pole had been shaken down or the camera was pulled off by someone standing on another‚Äôs shoulders. Some (not all) Flock poles are two poles screwed together which can be unscrewed using T27 security bits easily acquired at hardware stores, so the entire top pole containing camera and solar panel is removed in seconds of ease!

10 cameras had their lenses spray-painted by someone standing on another‚Äôs shoulders. While this obviously does less economic and physical damage, it is quick and nearly silent. Pay close attention to how long it takes to clean up this work. Previously it has taken Flock up to a month to replace broken or missing cameras.

As long as there is the political will to surveil us anywhere and everywhere we turn, cameras will continue to proliferate. As long as they do, one must find new and creative ways to blind them.

Atlanta‚Äôs back on top of the Flock game. Anyone wanna come for the high score?

- - -¬†

We're here on October 10th, a year after the historic jailbreak from the Gaza prison by the Palestinian resistance, and the subsequent US-Israel genocide unleashed against the people of Palestine. Those US-made bombs have slaughtered well over 100,000 Palestinians, and the genocide has shown no sign for stopping, expanding to the West Bank, to Yemen, and to Lebanon where over 2,000 people have been killed in the last month alone.¬†

In August, Brandon Johnson and the City of Chicago rolled out the red carpet for the people responsible for this genocide, some of the most monstrous criminals on the planet today: Genocide Joe and Killer Kamala, the people who have rubber stamped every check, who have co-signed every bomb, the people who have joined Israel at every step of this genocide with full knowledge of the families extinguished, the prisoners tortured and sexually assaulted, the churches, mosques, schools and hospitals leveled. In defense of this DNC, what we call the Death and Nakba Coronation, Brandon Johnson and his henchman CPD superintendent Larry Snelling occupied the Near West Side of Chicago with thousands of the CPD's killer cops, in a massive show of force and intimidation.¬†

Johnson and Snelling succeeded in taming some of the protesters, by tangling permits and promises of porta-potties. Not everyone. Not us.¬†

On August 20th, we rallied in front of the Israeli consulate to demonstrate our support for the people of Palestine, and tried to march to confront the war-makers in the citadel of the United Center.¬† Instead, Snelling and Johnson made clear that they stand with genocide over the people of Chicago and staged a police riot. Protesters were beaten with batons, thrown against concrete planters, and brutally arrested.¬† After being arrested, they were held for hours in dark vans, and then again for hours in unhygienic jail cells.¬†

Now the city of Chicago wants to subject us, alongside the other people it unjustly arrested during the DNC, to death by a thousand cuts: months of byzantine bureaucratic court hearings, dragged out over months. Just last week the city's lawyer claimed that they need an additional two months to review hundreds of hours of police body camera footage. It was reported yesterday that the city has paid out more than $100 Million in police misconduct lawsuits over the last five years. How much money does it cost to prosecute us? When the schools are in desperate need of funds and the CTA is barely functional, why is it a priority of Brandon Johnson to pursue dozens of prosecutions of people who stood up to genocide? How much does it cost for the law department to review hundreds of hours of footage and drag us to court every other month? Ten's of thousands of dollars? More?¬†

However much the city throws at us, we won't back down. Whatever indignities and injustices we faced and are facing are nothing compared to what people in Gaza are going through. On August 20th, we demonstrated that people in this country will not go along with the genocide program, no matter what party carries it out. We'll continue to live up to that obligation, by getting the backs of the people who dare to resist, by refusing to take any deals, and by continuing to expose everyone who collaborates with the US-Israel genocide, from Genocide Joe to Brandon Johnson.¬†

Drop all the charges against DNC protesters!¬†
It's right to rebel against genocide!¬†

Unity of Fields remembers him by sharing his texts:

‚ÄúLet us sum up as follows our aspirations for victory. Destruction of imperialism by means of eliminating its strongest bulwark: the imperialist domination of the United States of North America. To take as a tactical line the gradual liberation of the peoples, one by one or in groups, involving the enemy in a difficult struggle outside his terrain; destroying his bases of support, that is, his dependent territories.‚Äù

- [**Notes for the Study of the Ideology of the Cuban Revolution**](https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/10/08.htm)

""This is a unique revolution which some people maintain contradicts one of the most orthodox premises of the revolutionary movement, expressed by Lenin: ""Without a revolutionary theory there is no revolutionary movement."" It would be suitable to say that revolutionary theory, as the expression of a social truth, surpasses any declaration of it; that is to say, even if the theory is not known, the revolution can succeed if historical reality is interpreted correctly and if the forces involved are utilised correctly. Every revolution always incorporates elements of very different tendencies which, nevertheless, coincide in action and in the revolution's most immediate objectives.

It is clear that if the leaders have an adequate theoretical knowledge prior to the action, they can avoid trial and error whenever the adopted theory corresponds to the reality.

The principal actors of this revolution had no coherent theoretical criteria; but it cannot be said that they were ignorant of the various concepts of history, society, economics, and revolution which are being discussed in the world today.

Profound knowledge of reality, a close relationship with the people, the firmness of the liberator's objective, and the practical revolutionary experience gave to those leaders the chance to form a more complete theoretical concept.""",MessageMediaPhoto,False,Not Available,None,[],"['https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1967/04/16.htm)', 'https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/10/08.htm)']",109,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/742,2429.0,22.0,No Replies

We are entering into a regime of direct censorship. Indirect forms continue to be used in an attempt to intimidate the masses into censoring themselves, but that intimidation increasingly comes in the mode of direct censorship, making examples of the individuals and organizations acting as hubs of communication by singling them out for punishment...

Given the obvious weaknesses and dangers of electronic communications in resistance work, as underlined by current events, we must begin the process of establishing and strengthening in-person communication and material distribution of resistance propaganda...

This does not mean we should stop using electronic communications altogether... The goal should be to seize as much benefit as possible from these modes of communication, while not becoming overly dependent or exposed, and while building out alternative distribution networks. Consequently, while endeavoring to access all electronic channels under cover of anonymity, we must move to more censorship resistant channels; for example, from Twitter and Instagram to Telegram. We should expect to make moves of this type repeatedly as electronic channels that were previously resistant to censorship become compromised, and new channels are developed in response. Over the longer term, we must create and strengthen distribution networks for material propaganda (books, zines, pamphlets, etc.) while inculcating a culture that prioritizes these forms of communication over electronic forms.

This PSL [statement](https://www.liberationnews.org/psl-statement-we-will-stay-in-the-streets-until-palestine-is-free/) on the anniversary of the heroic Al-Aqsa Flood epitomizes the arrogance and delusions of the Counterinsurgency Left in the US. They‚Äôre taking a victory lap a year into an accelerating genocide, breaking their arm patting themselves on the back for the demobilizing role they‚Äôve played since November 2023.

The first sentence of their statement centers the United States, but even that framework is too broad. The further one reads the narrower the focus becomes, finally centering on the PSL‚Äôs own half-hearted and feckless protests.

There is no mention of the Palestinian Resistance, let alone the specific faction that led and leads the Al Aqsa Flood revolt, Hamas. No mention of the Axis of Resistance. No notice of the sacrifices of Hezbollah, or Ansarallah. No notice of the war against Syria and Iran.

Nor is there mention of the martyrs and prisoners in the US. No mention of Aaron Bushnell, Matt Nelson, and the anonymous woman in Atlanta, who all made the greatest sacrifice that anyone can make in protest of evil.

No mention of the specific cases of repression and imprisonment, whether the Merrimack 4, Casey Goonan, or any of the hundreds of others facing jail time across the country.

In short, recognition of resistance of any kind, whether on the ground in Palestine or within the US movement, is completely missing from the PSL‚Äôs statement. Not even the word ‚Äúresistance‚Äù makes an appearance.

As for PSL's efficacy, they're telling lies & claiming easy victories. Their measure of impact is the number of ppl mobilized to march in circles. Impact isn't measured in terms of the freedom of zionists to commit genocide. If it were, they'd have to admit to no impact at all.

Nothing has been ‚ÄúShut Down‚Äù or meaningfully disrupted by their protests. The Student Intifada is the only wave of protest to cause sustained disruption to business as usual over the last year.

But these protests have been rooted in frustration with the limits set by PSL and the Counterinsurgency Left. IOW, the most advanced struggles in the United States in the last year happened in spite of PSL‚Äôs mobilizations, not because of them.

Moreover, the numbers PSL claims are a lie. Back in November 2023, they claimed their march had 300k attendees, 11mths later and the number has grown to 500k.

They exaggerate the numbers at their marches, while giving no account of the shrinking numbers at each subsequent mobilization. The movement gains nothing from these exaggerations. These distortions serve no other purpose than self aggrandizement for PSL.

Instead of congratulating themselves, PSL cadre should stop to consider how their leadership have acted as a brake on the advancement of resistance in the US. They should reflect on why resistance is not the beginning and the end of their statement regarding the Al Aqsa Flood. 

Ask these questions & seek their answers honestly, and you will recognize that PSL is not an organization that is leading or can lead a [revolutionary mvt](https://clarion.unity-struggle-unity.org/2024-3-6-revolution-in-our-lifetime/).

In the early hours of Monday, October 7, autonomous actionists embellished the entrance to a CCNY building to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Al-Aqsa Flood jail break from Gaza & to echo widespread calls for CUNY divestment from apartheid and genocide among its community of 275k+ students.

We amplify community calls for:
1) disclosure & divestment of its ~$8.5 million holdings in complicit companies such as Dell, IBM, HP, Lenovo, Cisco, and BMC Software,
2) academic boycott of all trips to the zionist entity,
3) protections for students & workers expressing solidarity with the Palestinian liberation struggle,

5) a People‚Äôs CUNY to support community members at large. Shame on Chancellor F√©lix Matos Rodr√≠guez and President Vincent Boudreau for security coordination with the pigs who brutalize principled, peaceful protesters.

We know CUNY is eminently capable of fulfilling these demands due to the 1984 Board of Trustees decision to divest from apartheid South Africa! Solidarity to the student intifada, solidarity to the Palestinian resistance, and glory to the martyrs of Palestine. The entity will fall!

**DEFUND GENOCIDE**

Today we remember not just one year since October 7th, 2023, but we also remember the genocide that Palestinians have been resisting since 1948. We remember the over 186,000 Palestinians martyred by the Zionist entity. We remember that we, as Americans, are complicit in the genocide as American imperialism allows ""Israel"" to exist and funds the murder of oppressed peoples worldwide.

**We targeted Citibank today because of its role in the genocide of Palestinians**. It boasts having ""the largest presence of any foreign financial institution in Israel"", providing services for Israel to secure money and weapons to perpetuateing its genocide against the Palestinian people. Furthermore, according to Bloomberg, Citi was the sole underwriter of a $500 million bond to Israel in January 2024, shortly after the start of the genocide in Gaza. Citi has also facilitated the sale of billions in bonds for Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, makers of the missiles and fighter jets Israel uses in Gaza. Citibank also invests and partners with Israel's tech sector, which develops and deploys technology to surveil and terrorize Palestinians.

Citibank is also implicated in crimes committed in the West Bank through their ownership stake in two of Israel's largest banks: Bank Leumi and Israel Discount Bank, both of which play an essential role in funding illegal settlements.

Economic activism in 1987 forced Citibank to divest from apartheid South Africa and through direct action we will force Citibank to divest from the genocide of the Palestinian people. **We will continue to learn from the tenacity of the Axis of Resistance and will continue to resist until all imperial and colonial states fall, and until we win the liberation of all oppressed people worldwide. Glory to all the martyrs and glory to the Intifada.

**Do not speak of solidarity when you must speak of resistance**. Do not gesture towards our cause, our people with your icons and symbols. Your slogans, watermelons, and keffiyehs must not convert our livelihoods into signifiers as our bodies are evaporated by bombs. Your solidarity must not be steeped in self-satisfaction and white saviourism. **Our cause is a collective cause. We speak of your liberation too**.

If it is normal that we move freely while Gazans are besieged, that we eat while they starve, sleep while they evacuate from bombs, if it is normal that those with the most weapons and the most money get to decide who dies and who lives, then **we reject the frames of normalization and find it our duty to bring the world to a halt. Their blood is no different than yours**.

We believe in a world where when bombs drop in Gaza, the world stops at once. We want to live in a society that witnesses genocidal aggression and acts upon it, understanding: This must stop by all means necessary. We mean what we say when we speak our truth to power. Our words are anchored by the resistance in Gaza, in Lebanon, and around the world. May they penetrate your hearts and stir you into action.

Resistance against injustice is a call that connects us to our own dignity and to each other beyond any oppressive system. Resistance means fighting for each others lives. Because resistance is love, a form which cannot be overcome.

A year ago, the Palestinian resistance forces launched the heroic Al-Aqsa Flood Operation,¬†breaking out of the Gaza concentration camp¬†and breaking open the gates to a new world.¬†From hang-gliders, rocket launchers, and tunnels, Gaza has rewritten the rules of guerrilla warfare, exposed the zionist entity and the US empire as paper tigers, and reasserted the global anti-imperialist revolution.¬†**The Al-Aqsa Flood put the questions of armed struggle and national liberation back on the table.¬†**

Unable to defeat the resistance forces in Palestine or Lebanon, the zionist entity has aimed at destroying their popular cradle, the resistance‚Äôs mass base of support and regeneration, by massacring, torturing, and starving millions of Palestinians.¬†**What is happening in Gaza must be understood as a genocide, but also as a war of national liberation waged by the Palestinian people and the broader Axis of Resistance against the US-NATO-zionist imperialist bloc**. This declining empire is now expanding the Gaza doctrine to Lebanon and provoking a regional war, which it will certainly lose.

A year into this intensified stage of the 75-year genocide, what does the world who promised to stand with Palestine have to show?¬†Nothing has stopped the genocide yet, but the Axis of Resistance's armed actions have done more to deter the zionist entity than any UN resolutions, international law proceedings, or ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù protest movements.¬†One thing is clear: it is not enough for us to ""have solidarity."" It is not enough for us to ""bear witness."" It is not enough for us to hold teach-ins, vigils, and permitted parades week after week. 

When we chant, ""Resistance is justified when people are occupied,"" do not let that be an abstraction.

**For those who resist the freedom to speak is not a privilege granted by a ruling class of slaveowners and genocidaires**. For us, there is only censorship and opprobrium from our class enemy, its state, and its settler lynch mobs. For us, the freedom to speak must be fought for, defended, and propagated in spite of the political violence imposed upon our movement - a movement for life and liberation from the death drive of imperialist world domination. In this way, **freedom of speech is better understood as the freedom to resist, a freedom that is not granted to us, but which we create in defiance of ruling class repression**. 

In the face of all this repression, at all costs we must continue to communicate, and we must do this while simultaneously increasing the reach of our ideas and **developing increasingly resilient systems and networks to avoid censorship**. This is in line with the common admonition to ‚Äúkeep talking about Palestine.‚Äù Our refusal to be silent about the Zionist genocide against the Palestinian people is what accounts for the longevity of the movement in the US thus far. But it is insufficient. **Going forward, not only must we talk about Palestine, we must also talk about imperialism, resistance and revolution**. In so doing, our resistance will grow stronger, but so too will the repression of the ruling class.

Valero Energy, HQ'd in TX, is the main supplier of military-grade jet fuel (JP-8) to ""Israeli's"" military. Chevron, BP, Exxon, and Shell are also complicit in facilitating the supply of crude oil to ""Israel's"" military. All have seats on the board of TXOGA.

**Q**. It is possible to see the posters of Che, Chavez and Ahmadinejad side by side in the streets of Beirut. Are these the signs of a new polarization?

**Hasan Nasrallah**: We salute the leaders and the peoples of Latin America. They have resisted the American bandits heroically and have been a source of moral strength for us. They are guiding the way for the oppressed peoples. Go and wonder around our streets..! You will witness how our people have embraced Chavez and Ernesto Che Guevara. Nearly in every house, you will come across posters of Che or Chavez.

What we are saying to our socialist friends who want fight together with us for fraternity and freedom is: Do not come at all if you are going to say ‚ÄúReligion is an opiate‚Äù. We do not agree with this analysis. Here is the biggest proof of this in our streets with the pictures of Chavez, Che, Sadr and Khamenei together. These leaders are saluting our people in unison. **So long as we respect your beliefs, and you respect ours, there is no imperialist power we cannot defeat!
**
**Q**. Returning to threats in the region, western governments are intensifying their pressure on Damascus and Tehran, for which they are proposing a ‚Äúchange of regime.‚Äù Some sources are of the view that the attack on Lebanon will be directed on Syria. According to your point of view, is a regional war possible?

**Hasan Nasrallah**: The centers of imperialist power want to make collaborators of our region as a whole. They expect us to kneel before them. Syria, Iran and Hezbollah are opposing this. The provocation concerning the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the efforts to secure the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon and ‚Äî going even further ‚Äî their wish to attack callously on to Tehran and Damascus are all due to this reason.

Syria, with Iran and Hezbollah will certainly resist this. We are going to resist for our motherland and freedom. We are going to resist in order not kneel before them. The imperialists of the west are seeking to make a second Kosovo out of Lebanon and our region. They are seeking to create a clash in between sects. But we have spoiled this trick. **In our streets, the whole of Lebanon, with its Christian, Sunnis and Shias, are flying the flags of Hezbollah. Again, ‚Äúthe unipolar world‚Äù has already been left behind in history. There is us, there is Iran, there is Syria, there is Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea. There are the resisting peoples of Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan! As long as there is imperialism and occupations, these people will continue resisting**. They can forget about peace. If they want peace, they should now respect the freedom of peoples and should eliminate the collaborators. God willing, the victory will be ours.

**They are not going to be able to turn our country and region into a Kosovo**. Now our people are aware of everything and will not play into imperialist tricks. We will absolutely not permit them to attack Iran or Syria. We are going to fight for our freedom to the last drop of our blood. Let no one doubt this. They are claiming that Iran has nuclear weapons at its disposal. On the contrary, most of the nuclear weapons are in the hands of Israel and the US. Furthermore, nuclear weapons are nothing but excuses put forward in order to create collaborating regimes in the region.

**Q**. There are claims that Hezbollah is being directed by Tehran. What are your views on this issue?

**Hasan Nasrallah**: This is a great lie. We are an independent Lebanese organization. We do not take orders from anyone. But this does not mean that we are not going to form alliances. We are on the side of Iran and Syria. They are our brothers. **We are going to oppose any attack directed at Tehran and Damascus to the last drop of our blood just as we do in Lebanon.

With hundreds of thousands of Palestinians martyred and the zionist entity increasing its aggression against Lebanon, the need for escalated action is clear.

Gantcher Building, where tufts' annual career fair was held today, was targeted and redecorated last night. The companies advertising at the career fair include the us army, MIT's lincoln labs (LL), MITRE (a ""defense"" company making weapons for the military) and tufts's investment officers, which are complicit both in the genocidal zionist project and repression at home. This action took place under the nose of the TUPD officers and cars stationed outside of Gantcher last night to prevent something like this from happening.¬†

We call on everyone, at tufts, at other schools, in the wider community - to follow in our footsteps of autonomous action. The consequences of such actions may feel daunting, but they are incomparably small to the risks Palestinians face by existing in Palestine. That is why we all must escalate.

‚Äî
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,

His Eminence the Secretary-General, our most sacred and exalted martyr, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may your noble essence be sanctified.

Peace be upon you, our master, peace be upon you, our beloved, peace be upon your noble head as a fighting leader, and peace be upon your soul as a sincere martyr. Peace be upon you from the positions of our artillery, from the barrages of our rockets, and from our Husseini fists which have always, still are, and will always continue to be, clenched on the trigger, through which Allah Almighty strikes the corruptors in His land and the killers of His prophets and servants.

O our master, the beloved of our hearts, we thank Allah Almighty who has blessed us with the grace of Jihad in His cause under your leadership, honored us with your acquaintance, living in your time, and dignified us to follow you in the footsteps of your grandfather, Imam Hussein, the martyr, peace be upon him, to fight the enemies of Allah and humanity in defense of the oppressed and the downtrodden, liberating the land, and protecting our dear people.

O our Sayyed and the beloved of our hearts, our souls will bear witness before Allah Almighty that you have delivered the trust and kept the covenant that you made and we made with you, and patiently endured in anticipation. You led us from victory to victory until your noble soul overflowed to join the long caravan of your beloved martyrs, the fighters, and the leaders.

For so long, O our Sayyed, we have chanted with our voices and hearts in the fields of jihad, ‚ÄúAt your service, O Nasrallah.‚Äù For so long, we have echoed behind you the call to reject humiliation: ‚ÄúVerily, the illegitimate son of the illegitimate father has made us choose between two things: between battle and humiliation, and never to humiliation!‚Äù For so long, we have stood by you in the stance of the supporters of your grandfather, Hussein (peace be upon him), when he told them, ‚ÄúThis night has enveloped you, so take it as a camel [a means to escape].‚Äù And today we say to you: why would we do that? To remain after you? By Allah, even if we knew that we would be killed, burned, and scattered in the air a thousand times, we would not abandon your path, nor forsake the covenant we made with you.

O His Eminence, the Secretary-General, the greatest jihadist leader, the leader of the caravan of fighters, martyrdom-seekers, and martyrs of the march of Hezbollah's path of jihad and resistance, the supporter of the oppressed and the free of the world, may Allah not sweeten life for us after you‚Ä¶ We swear by your noble soul from the borders of Palestine where you went as a martyr on its path, and from the sites of the Islamic Resistance across the homeland, that we, by Allah, will remain bound to our covenant, and on our promise, until we achieve your hopes and goals, no matter how great the sacrifices.

As for the arrogant, delusional enemy, we say: The days and nights and the battlefield are between us. You will meet us as skilled archers, from where you expect and where you do not expect.

And to our patient, noble, and loyal people, we say: We swear by the groans of the tormented and by the torn limbs, the killer will not be safe from our wrath and our revenge, nor will he weaken our resolve.

**‚ÄúAmerica is a prison! Abolition now!‚Äù**

To symbolize the extension of the genocidal, fascist carceral systems that permeate every facet of modern america, we wanted to remind commuters that fascism is not some looming specter on the horizon, but material reality right now for so many occupied communities. The orgy of surveillance, the disappearance of unhoused people in the lead-up to the Super Bowl, the social death of the poor as we struggle to afford basic necessities under an ongoing pandemic, the hollow spectacle of electoral politics.

The cages extend into schools, hospitals, mental health facilities, treatment centers, ‚Äúlow-income‚Äù housing, into the way we interact and police each other and ourselves.

We wish to remind people of the infinite possibilities for collective resistance against colonialism, of the world-making that continues ongoing in the face of fascism here in the US, in Palestine, and across the globe.

We remain vigilant in attending to Marcellus Khalifah Williams's collective remembrance: his spirit lives on in our struggle and resistance.

Four Palestine Action activists ‚Äî Paige Belanger, Sophie Ross, Bridget Shergalis, and Calla Walsh ‚Äî were facing extreme felony charges for attacking the Elbit Systems facility in Merrimack, New Hampshire on 20 November 2023. **Now, the Merrimack 4 are resolving their case and will serve 60 days in county jail as Amerikan justice for resisting genocide and disrupting production at the largest zionist weapons company.
**
The Merrimack [protest](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/12/the-case-against-the-merrimack-three-is-an-attack-on-the-palestine-movement-as-a-whole/) ‚Äî characterized by the state as a ‚Äúsiege and riot‚Äù‚Äî involved a simultaneous road blockade, roof occupation, and attack on the building‚Äôs fa√ßade causing tens of thousands of dollars in damages and, for the day, shutting down the facility where¬†workers produce weapons that surveil, massacre, and torture Palestinians. 

Read the full report: unityoffields.org/merrimack-4-defeat-felony-charges

**After nearly a year of the state‚Äôs failed attempts to intimidate and break the Merrimack 4, the NH AGs are now dropping all the felony charges, which totaled 37 years in prison. **The co-defendants are pleading guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief and criminal trespass. Their sentence includes 60 days in jail, a 24-month suspended sentence for 3 years, and a stay-away order from every Elbit Systems facility, among other conditions.

Ross and Walsh still face several charges for direct actions in Cambridge, Massachusetts where protestors successfully shut down the first Elbit office in the US. 

Information on how to support the Merrimack 4 and write to them in jail will be publicized when available.¬†

**Losing comrades to jail, even for a short period, is painful for the movement ‚Äî but the Merrimack 4‚Äôs defeat of felony charges and avoidance of decades in prison is a major win against repression.

**Monday night at the Bedford Ave L train station in Brooklyn, we smashed 8 OMNY readers**, 1 OMNY machine, and 2 MTA machines. We made the fare FREE because they had to open the emergency door to let people in. **This is in direct response to the L train mass shooting committed by NYPD, when they shot Derrel Mickells and two bystanders over $2.90, in a Black neighborhood under militarized police occupation. New Yorkers say enough is enough and fuck your fare.**

We live in a world in which the pig enforcers of racial capitalism can casually shoot us over a few dollars. All our lives especially Black lives are worth less than $2.90 to them. Whether it's paying the pigs to menace Black and Brown communities and restrict movement, for funding genocide near and far, or creating technology to convenience the rich and confine the poor, capitalism is designed to kill.

They were allowed out twice afterward. It has now been seven days since we have heard from him.

The Bureau of Prisons calls it ""modified housing."" **It is solitary confinement, and it is torture. In Leonard's case, it could be deadly. It has been fatal for several prisoners**. It is also a violation of the 8th Amendment clause against Cruel and Unusual punishment and a violation of international law.

Please spread the word. Speak out in whatever way you can. Ask questions. Why are federal prisoners not allowed communication? State prisoners are allowed email and phone on their tablets. It does not pose a security threat. Why are federal prisoners forced to suffer severe isolation? 

Leonard needs medical care that is not being provided. Even the Parole Examiner ""strongly suggested"" that Leonard be evaluated for a medical transfer. Why is the Bureau of Prisons operating as if it is a sovereign nation with no regulation and no oversight?

On Leonard's website's Act Now page, we have contact information for the Senate Judiciary Committee and a sample letter explaining why it is their duty to ensure the BOP adheres to Constitutional law.

The Parole Commission, which was supposed to be abolished in 1984, deliberately applies the wrong laws to keep ""old law"" prisoners imprisoned decades past their lawful release dates.

Read the full piece on [**UnityOfFields.org**](https://unityoffields.org/synthesis-of-lessons-from-encampment-mobilisations-in-britain/)

In reflecting on the recent encampment mobilisations, it becomes clear that while significant efforts were made to organize resistance, these actions fell short of evolving into a fully-fledged revolutionary movement. The encampments were largely isolated and disorganized, demonstrating a lack of cohesive strategy, long-term planning, and genuine leadership.

Liberalism within the ranks ‚Äî manifesting as fear of escalation, individualism, and comfort in moderation ‚Äî further stifled progress. We must confront these issues directly to build a disciplined, ideologically-driven movement capable of real revolutionary change.

**Key Lessons and Forward Steps**:

1. Combatting Liberalism through Political Education and Ideological Clarity
2. Organizing Structures for Movement Building
3. Isolating and Expelling Liberalism
4. Rejecting Moderate Approaches and Escalating Struggle
5. Developing a Cohesive and Strategic Movement with Long-Term Planning

...The lessons from the encampments are clear. Without strong, centralized organizing structures, and without mechanisms to confront and isolate liberalism, our efforts will remain fragmented and unsuccessful. A revolutionary movement cannot accommodate moderate stances or individualism. Instead, we must build collective structures grounded in discipline, ideological clarity, and a commitment to long-term struggle.

**As Al-Araj emphasized, revolution is not spontaneous; it requires preparation, knowledge, and strategy**.

The struggle must be uncompromising, Decolonial**, and focused on the liberation of the masses, not limited by bourgeois or liberal values. By centering revolutionary education, fostering genuine community alliances, and creating real decision-making structures, we can build a movement capable of escalating action on a national level. Through organized, strategic, and ideologically grounded action, we can advance the struggle against capitalism and imperialism, ensuring that future mobilizations transcend the limitations of the past.",MessageMediaPhoto,False,Not Available,None,[],['https://unityoffields.org/synthesis-of-lessons-from-encampment-mobilisations-in-britain/)'],129,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/536,2538.0,30.0,No Replies

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 
The Almighty said: ""O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination."" 
This is the Truth of Allah, the Almighty. 

In support of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters,

The missile force of the Yemeni Armed Forces, with the help of Allah Almighty, carried out a [qualitative](https://t.me/PalestineResist/57441) military operation targeting an ""israeli"" enemy military objective in the area of [Yaffa](https://t.me/PalestineResist/49780) in occupied Palestine.

The operation was executed with [a new hypersonic ballistic missile](https://t.me/PalestineResist/57450), which, by the grace of Allah, [successfully reached](https://t.me/PalestineResist/57447) its target. The [enemy's defenses failed](https://t.me/PalestineResist/57458) to intercept and counter it. The missile traveled a distance of approximately 2,040 km in 11 and a half minutes, causing fear and panic among the zionists, with [more than two million zionists ](https://t.me/PalestineResist/57452)rushing to shelters for the first time in the history of the ""israeli"" enemy.

This operation is part of the fifth phase and is the culmination of the efforts of the heroic missile forces, who made tremendous efforts in developing missile technology to meet the requirements and challenges of the battle against the zionist enemy, and successfully reach its target and overcoming all obstacles, including American and ""israeli"" interception systems on land and sea, as well as other systems.

**The obstacles of geography, the American-British aggression, and the surveillance, espionage, and defense systems will not prevent dear Yemen from fulfilling its religious, moral, and humanitarian duty in supporting the Palestinian people. The ""israeli"" enemy should expect more strikes and special operations in the future, as we approach the first anniversary of the blessed October 7th operation. These operations include responses to their criminal aggression on the city of Al-**[**Hodeidah**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/49369)**, as well as continued support for the oppressed Palestinian people.**

Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs, the best Master and the best Helper.

Long live Yemen, free, proud, and independent.  
Victory to Yemen and to all the free people of the nation.

‚Äî
**The Harris-Trump debate is a race to support the zionist genocide and both parties are panting over which of them is more loyal to the zionist entity.**

The last debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump comes to confirm once again that there is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties regarding the Arab-zionist conflict and supporting the occupation and the genocide war against our Palestinian people. The two parties rushed to defend the ""right of the zionist entity to defend itself"", and competed to show which of them is more loyal to this entity.

While Harris, the Democratic Party candidate, outlined her vision of the conflict by adopting the misleading zionist narrative about the events of October 7, she continued to talk about her party leading the war on Gaza directly, and establishing a bridge to transfer weapons that contribute to the extermination of our people and the destruction of the Strip, and she also gave a blank check to continue supporting the occupation without conditions.

In contrast, the Republican Party candidate Trump expressed himself as the ""permanent protector and savior"" or ""the awaited Messiah"" of the zionist entity, stressing his readiness to provide all possible support.

These expected positions expressed by the two candidates in their full support for the zionist entity require the free voices inside America that support the cause of our people or reject the influence of the zionist lobby to use the ballot box as a means of pressuring the two parties to stop American sponsorship of the ongoing war of extermination in Gaza, and to struggle to bring about a radical change in American policy towards the zionist entity, despite the difficulty of that, at least in the near future.

What came in the debate between the candidates of the two American parties confirms that America remains America; the head of evil in the world and the sponsor of zionist terrorism, and there will be no change in the positions of the two parties unless the American public realizes that it is paying the price for the two parties' gambling with their future and privileges, and their squandering of tax money in favor of the zionist entity and their surrender to the will of the zionist lobby.

NYPD, KKK, IOF, THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

As we heed the Palestinian resistance's call, we must remember that the nypd and israel are two heads of the same snake. The ""war on terror"" of the early 2000s led u.s. law enforcement (including the nypd) to attend official training expeditions to the zionist state in order to exchange ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù in ‚Äúcounter-terrorism‚Äù. After his 2023 trip to the zionist state, adams returned ""inspired"" by the iof's use of drone technology, and subsequently implemented unmanned surveillance drones across nyc. In Gaza, drones are used to much deadlier effect. On numerous occasions, such as the Flour Massacre in February 2024, drones have been used to kill unarmed civilians in densely populated areas. 

We know by now that pigs do not keep us safe: 600+ people are killed and more than 250,000 civilians are injured by pigs annually in the united states. Reports of abuse at the hands of the nypd have surged since adams became mayor. Annually, an average of 9 New Yorkers are murdered by pigs‚Äîin 2022, that number rose to 13. That same year, 9 people were pronounced dead while in nypd custody. Since 2021, complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board have increased 51%, with New Yorkers filing 5,604 complaints‚Äîa ten-year record. The nypd spent $115 million on misconduct payouts last year alone. Not only that, but officers enjoy relative impunity within the nypd‚Äôs internal affairs process. adam's first police commissioner, keechant sewell, reversed internal affair's discipline rulings at a record rate, reducing or annulling penalties for more than half of all pigs found to have committed misconduct at an administrative trial during her term. 

What is this cop city for, if not training up masses of trigger-happy pigs? What can we do when these violent hordes are set loose on civilians as a means of protecting the interests of a rich minority? How do we respond to a state and system hellbent on the total suppression of any and all resistance to the capitalist, imperialist nightmare threatening all human and nonhuman life? 

What does it mean for us when we're faced with organized abandonment, dispossession, disenfranchisement, and the reality that our tax dollars are currently funding the Palestinian genocide? 

THIS MEANS WAR.

For years, the state has been wielded as a weapon by the owning class in order to dispossess and subjugate those at the mercy of their predations, both within and beyond the borders of the united states. To those who put their faith in reform: you do not understand that the entire system is compromised, septic, unsalvageable. It is not enough to merely ""kill the cop in our heads"" or ""decolonize our minds"". We must attack the physical strongholds of the colonizer, the cop, and all those who unjustly wield their power, and we must strike from all angles. Leaving them unchecked allows the rot to spread; pig deputy mayor phil banks states that he ""hopes the academy will be a model for other cities across the country"". We must refute this.

This banner drop is not an action, but a call. May we heed the burning of Minneapolis's 3rd precinct a thousand times over. We call on our allies to organize, escalate, to shake off the torpor, the weariness, the fear. Resist. As for our enemies‚Äîthe false comfort and peace that you take for granted is bought with the blood of millions. When our time comes, we will make no apologies for what we do to you.

NO COP CITY IN QUEENS! FUCK YOU, ADAMS‚ÄîTHIS MEANS WAR.

In September 2021, the city of Atlanta leased 381 acres of Weelaunee Forest to the Atlanta Police Foundation for a $90 million dollar training facility, funded by bloodthirsty corporations. Atlanta‚Äôs Cop City is modeled off of the iof‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Gaza‚Äù facility, which was built in 2006 with $45 million dollars of US aid. These mock cities are the training grounds in which the pigs perfect ‚Äúurban warfare strategies‚Äù with the express purpose of stifling organized dissent, perpetuating gentrification, and increasing violence against our most vulnerable communities‚Äîparticularly Black, Indigenous, and brown communities. As of July 31 2024, there are 80 cop city projects in the works in 49 of 50 states, all of this against the backdrop of a for-profit penal system.

In New York City, the concept of a cop city extends far beyond official training grounds, bleeding into all aspects of civilian life. Even before the greenlighting of Queens' $225 million dollar pigsty, New Yorkers have been facing unprecedented levels of state repression, and relentless surveillance by a police force large and powerful enough to be considered a standing army. 

The purported goal of Queens' cop city‚Äîset to break ground in 2026, in College Point‚Äîis to consolidate training for 18 city agencies, including the department of sanitation, homeless services, the administration for children's services, parks enforcement, and the department of corrections, among others; essentially, it aims to militarize city government workers.  Meanwhile, eric adams is slashing hundreds of millions of dollars from homeless services, children's services and other programs that New Yorkers depend on‚ÄîSNAP, medicaid, libraries,  and rental vouchers, for example‚Äîin order to pad the nypd's already-bloated budget to a record-breaking $12 billion in 2025. We've all seen the increase of pigs in our communities, the national guard at subway stations, private security firms such as Allied partnering with the MTA. We've seen the blueprints for a 300-ft. high jail in Chinatown. We've seen an increase in violent sweeps of both street vendors and our homeless neighbors. 

New Yorkers are already subject to unrelenting surveillance via private and state-sponsored security cameras, the use of police drones, the implementation of OMNY technology, which has the ability to track one's movements through public transit, AI-powered surveillance and facial recognition software in our subway systems. Similar surveillance technology, known as ""Red Wolf,"" is used in the apartheid zionist state at military checkpoints to keep Palestinians under constant observation, and to restrict their freedom of movement. Every day, Palestinians are subjected to algorithmic tracking, often barred from entering their own neighborhoods based on information stored in discriminatory surveillance databases.

‚Äî
The victorious [Aghwar operation](https://t.me/PalestineResist/56684) renews the memory of the [Battle of Karameh](https://t.me/PalestineResist/5647) and the long line of martyrdom that stretches from Kayed Mufleh Al-Obaidat to Saeed Al-Amro. This operation is the truest expression of the people's pulse, and its martyr is the martyr of every Jordanian home.

This morning, one of the heroes of the Jordanian people carried out a heroic and victorious operation this morning against the occupation soldiers on the zionist side of the King Hussein Bridge, which connects Jordan with our occupied lands in the West Bank. In light of this victorious operation, the Youth Gathering for Supporting the Resistance confirms the following:

**First:** This heroic and victorious operation, which resulted in the killing of three zionist soldiers before its executor ascended as a martyr, is a new chapter in the continuous line of martyrdom written by the blood of Jordanian martyrs. From the martyr Kayed Mufleh Al-Obaidat, who achieved martyrdom during the first revolts in Palestine during the Nabi Musa season in 1920, to Saeed Al-Amro, who attained martyrdom during the Knife Intifada in 2016, along with the thousands of martyrs of Jordan and its Arab army who passed while fighting the zionists in Jenin, Al-Quds, Al-Khalil, and Karameh.

**Second: **This heroic resistance action is the truest expression of the Jordanian people's conscience and their unwavering belief in resistance as the path and approach to confronting a treacherous and sinful enemy that engages in successive wars of genocide against our brothers and people in occupied Palestine.

**Third: **This operation targeted military objectives at the border point that separates the West Bank and cuts off our connection with our people and brothers on occupied land. It is an operation that possesses all forms of moral, national, Islamic, and even international legitimacy. The Jordanian government is required, at a minimum, to refrain from condemning it and must demand the return of the body of its heroic martyr.

**Fourth:** On March 10, 2014, members of this same military unit killed the Jordanian martyr, Judge Raed Zouaitar, and diplomatic tools did not lead to any results regarding his murder. Today, this operation serves as the fair and decisive response to that crime.

**Fifth:** The movement of goods and people between Jordan and the occupied territories is a natural human right for the people living under occupation and is not a gift or favor from the occupation. The fact that the occupation has chosen to assault and impose its control over this right does not exempt it from being targeted. In fact, its military teams tasked with this duty remain legitimate targets.

Finally: The Youth Gathering renews its call: the people want to overthrow Wadi Araba [Jordan-zionist peace agreement]. This is a demand that has been expressed through every popular means of expression, from protests and sit-ins to patience in the face of repression and arrest, to resistance and martyrdom today.

‚Äî
When the United States realized that there was no possibility for forced displacement, it initiated the Gaza port project as an opportunity to voluntarily displace people from Gaza to Cyprus and other countries.

From the first week, the zionist entity approved six foreign companies to start gas exploration and extraction, which for the past 15 years has been prevented from Palestinians investing in.

America seeks a foothold on the Mediterranean Sea similar to Russia, thus creating a balance of power.

America had strategically relied on the zionist entity, but in this particular war, it lost its confidence in its ""israeli"" proxy.

""Israel"" is in a predicament; it is deteriorating and facing internal contraction.

Even on political matters, the American administration does not trust the zionist entity, and Biden has started presenting initiatives on its behalf.

The United States wants a strong ""israel,"" but in reality, it is not. Therefore, America, along with ""israel,"" will look for another proxy in the region.

The main goal of the American initiative is to serve the ""israeli"" entity and to get it out of its internal crisis, which will worsen despite the initiative.

If the zionist entity does not accept the initiative, this war will continue and will extend beyond Rafah.

Whether the war continues or stops, Netanyahu is heading towards a political guillotine, and therefore he has no future within the entity.

The scene in Gaza has created global dynamics different from those before October 7, mobilizing the international community and the dominant global powers. Thus, the Al-Aqsa Flood was a global flood, not just a Palestinian one.

Today, China has interests and a common strategy with Russia based on the possibility of building a new international order, turning it into a multipolar world and depriving America of being the sole pole.

**2. Divestment is not an incrementalist goal. True divestment necessitates nothing short of the total collapse of the university structure and American empire itself**. It is not possible for imperial spoils to remain so heavily concentrated in the metropole and its high-cultural repositories without the continuous suppression of all populations that resist the empire's expansion; to divest from this is to undermine and eradicate America as we know it

**3. We refuse to allow Columbia to return to a state of ‚Äònormalcy‚Äô**. ‚ÄòNormalcy‚Äô is the structurally impelled displacement and eventual destruction of the Palestinian people

**4. We act in full support of the Palestinian resistance. **This action is first and foremost an effort to extend the successes of the Palestinian resistance to the heart of the empire itself, to translate their resilience in Gaza to unrest and violence in America

- This campaign clearly reflects and reaffirms Britain's bias toward the occupation and its suppression of all voices supporting the Palestinian cause.

- It is noteworthy that these increasing arrests and persecutions have significantly expanded since the Labour Party took power, a party that rose to power as a direct result of popular anger over the Conservative Party's involvement in the genocidal war on Gaza. **This indicates that there is no fundamental difference between the two parties except in tactics and the language used.**

- Britain, which continues its colonial policies and blatant bias toward the occupation, confirms through these actions that it does not intend to stop its aggressive practices and continuous support for zionist crimes, even with changes in government.

- The Front praises the massive activities and protests sweeping British cities in solidarity with Gaza and in rejection of British involvement in the aggression against the Palestinian people,** calling on activists and groups to escalate the movement against official British policies, especially against the presence of arms companies such as ""**[**Elbit**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/55352)**,"" which supplies the occupation with weapons and directly contributes to the crimes committed against the Palestinian people.**

After much speculation, a local paper just confirmed Elbit Systems terminated its lease at 130 Bishop Allen Drive, Cambridge. This comes after over **a year of relentless community organizing and protest organized by BDS Boston, as well as Palestine Action US autonomous direct actions, property damage, and clashes with the police**. Actionists targeted Elbit, its landlord (Intercontinental Real Estate), its co-tenants, and its collaborators to build pressure for eviction through a wide diversity of tactics -- but militancy is what gave the movement teeth. The most effective direct actions were clandestine and did not result in arrest. We stand with the actionists still facing charges for protesting Elbit.

Through this small victory, we see the effectiveness of secondary/tertiary targeting and an aboveground-underground strategy pairing autonomous direct actions with mass organizing. Look out for more reports and reflections from Cambridge soon. We will not stop until every Elbit and all genocide profiteers are shut down, until the ""US"" and ""Israel"" are dismantled!

[**From the article**](https://www.cambridgeday.com/2024/08/28/elbit-company-that-was-protested-weekly-confirms-it-is-moving-out-of-cambridge/): __BDS Boston, the organization that led the protests, said the end of Elbit‚Äôs lease ‚Äúis a testament to our collective power,‚Äù crediting ‚Äúvaried community efforts‚Äù for disrupting the operations of Elbit and its landlord, Intercontinental Management Corp., and ‚Äúforcing the early termination of the lease.‚Äù The group vowed to keep fighting to ‚Äúprevent Elbit from moving to another nearby location.‚Äù It also said it will continue efforts to ‚Äúsever Elbit‚Äôs ties with MIT and other actors in the Boston area.‚Äù An Intercontinental regional director, Scott Kelly, confirmed earlier in the day that Elbit had terminated its lease.

**‚ÄúWe will not consider ourselves victorious until Elbit Systems is dismantled and until Palestine is liberated,‚Äù** BDS Boston said.__

We are transitioning Palestine Action US into what it has become through necessity: a militant propaganda front against the US-NATO-zionist axis of imperialism.

How could we have only ""solidarity"" with the people __whose¬†suffering and death are required by our Amerikan way of living?__ It is not enough.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã**We have long exhausted the passive solidarity movement framework. The Palestinian insurgency launched on Oct 7 put the question of revolutionary anti-imperialist struggle back on the table, and the way forward is clear: It is our duty as people¬†in the imperial core to open a new front against the US Empire. To build the international popular cradle of resistance‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.**¬†Empires do not just collapse on their own; if victory over imperialism is possible, it will be because struggles against it have erupted all across the world, including here in the core.

The **Unity of Fields** concept comes from the Palestinian resistance; it refers to the coordination between all the factions on the battlefield despite their geographic fragmentation or ideological differences. As the resistance in Yemen said, ""**The meaning of the unity of the fields is that we are all one hand, one leadership, one direction, one goal, and one approach, and any attack on any of the components of the Axis is considered a direct attack on us**."" In the face of counterinsurgency¬†‚Äî carried out by both the forces of state repression and liberalism within the movement ‚Äî we need to overcome the **atomization**, **defanging**, and **disunity** of anti-imperialists. We don't mean unity for unity's sake, but **the protracted struggle it will take to reach a principled, higher unity against the forces of imperialism, zionism, and fascism.
**
Palestine Action US is not over, but our platforms are transforming into Unity of Fields, an anti-imperialist propaganda front. More to come soon. Submit actions, reports, and analyses to **the_unity_of_fields@proton.me**, and look out for our original reporting and propaganda.¬†Capitalist platforms will always censor revolutionary ideas, we must control our own means of media production.

The target was a Portland and Western Railroad bridge/trestle over the Willamette River between Lake Oswego and Milwaukie, Oregon.

We will respond to the civilization that destroys the earth and the possibility of free life with destruction in turn.

__‚ÄúThe track is closed to railroad traffic at this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúP&W (PNWR) traffic will be rerouted for quite a while, so Cornelius Pass may see a lot more action for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is some structural damage to the trestle, which is operated by P&W Railroad.‚Äù__

PNWR has a diverse traffic base based on carload commodities. Woodchips, paper, agricultural goods, and aggregates are all major sources of traffic. Primary amongst the road‚Äôs over 135 customers are Stimson Lumber Company, Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Georgia Pacific, and Hampton Lumber Sales. The rail also transports Oil from Exxon Mobile, Asphalt, and petroleum products. Rail is a primary method of transportation of materials for the industry that makes war possible.

The industrial activity responsible for climate collapse has no real interest in stopping its devastation but instead insists on pretending to be environmentally friendly and using terms such as ‚Äúgreen energy‚Äù, with new sources of extractive energy that are still harmful to ecosystems and our lives; And above all, with the clarity that each of us are the only ones who can combat the advance of devastation, we see the urgency of attacking the industry that destroys the earth, adding our initiative and action to the internationalist campaign. Switch Off!‚Äù switchoff.noblogs.org

May this action be a warm greeting of solidarity to those who have stuck blows such as the attacks on Cement Plants in Germany, the Mapuche Warriors fighting in Chile, Saboteurs of the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Vriginia, attackers of the techno-fascist progressive ‚Äúgreen energy‚Äù project ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù, **efforts against the military production companies such as Elbit powering the genocide of** **Palestinians, those steady fustrating the efforts of Cop City in Atlanta, GA**, and all those who take action recognizing that attack must be immediate and everywhere the facilities and means of those responsible for the devastation are located, contributing to dialogue through direct action and attack.

For those who we walk with on the offensive we greet warmly.

We take this action as a carrying of our dead. We have not forgotten and we carry on.

Cambridge Day just reported ""The Cambridge office of KMC Systems, a subsidiary of Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems, is virtually empty because ‚Äú99.9 percent‚Äù of employees work from home, police say, and there are other signs that the company is leaving the city.""

The local movement against Elbit put the idea of ""diversity of tactics"" into action, deploying weekly pickets and canvasses, home demos, secondary/tertiary targeting, and militant autonomous direct action and property damage to build pressure on Elbit and its enablers. In response to arrests and state repression, the movement did not back down. **Its militancy is what gave the movement teeth**. We encourage other locales to learn from the successful tactics used in Cambridge to go on the offensive against their local police/military infrastructure.

We salute our friends in BDS Boston, PYM Boston, Pal Action, and all autonomous formations who participated in the fight to #ShutElbitDown in Cambridge. Wherever Elbit moves, we will follow, until every war profiteer is vanquished, until Palestine is free!

**Report from **[**BDS Boston**](https://x.com/BDSBoston/status/1825200154892230725):

Reporters find that operations seem to have stopped at Elbit Systems' ""Cambridge Innovation Center,"" following relentless community pressure. Elbit & its Cambridge landlord Intercontinental refuse to confirm this information, hiding behind local police. Upon its [**opening in 2021**](https://t.co/RAcwfz4APo), Elbit claimed the Center would host up to 60 engineers, while benefiting from proximity to MIT, Harvard, and ""the region‚Äôs vibrant Life Sciences Corridor."" Three years later, the Center appears to be sitting virtually empty.

Elbit's failure to realize its ambitions for the Cambridge Innovation Center is a testament to the power of community organizing. But now is not the time to rest. We must force Intercontinental to fully remove Elbit from 130 Bishop Allen Drive. Be there this Wednesday 12PM.

Furthermore we must prevent Elbit from quietly moving its Cambridge Innovation Center to another location in the Boston area.

At least two hundred of our comrades in Bangladesh have been martyred by the Awami League in the past two weeks. At this very moment, the government is in the process of targeting, jailing, torturing, and enforcing the ‚Äúdisappearance‚Äù of all Bangladeshis who continue to resist. These martyrs are paying an unfathomable price for the Global Intifada. To escalate at that level, to genuinely threaten the state, cannot be achieved without inviting tremendous tragedy and loss to one‚Äôs own community. If we want to achieve liberation in America, we must be prepared to make these same sacrifices.

This moment should be galvanizing. It should move us not to mere sympathy or self-abnegation, but to purposeful, principled action. It should remind us that we are part of something that is bigger than ourselves, and that we cannot lose in the end. That while we may be lonely in the imperial core, we have the entire world behind our struggle. When students fight, they always win. The Bangladeshi students‚Äô triumph last Sunday, as well as their continued battle against the oppressive state, are universal experiences in the fight for global liberation. We recognize the success of the Biplob so far‚Äîas well as the necessity for continued struggle until the Awami League and fascism itself are destroyed. It is a struggle that we must join in.

We demand that the autocratic government of Bangladesh resign and give the people of Bangladesh the freedom they fought for in 1971. We demand that the American people confront their government‚Äôs participation in the 1971 genocide of Bangladeshis; we demand that they stop arming and training military agitators across the Global South.

We send love and wait to learn more from our comrades. 

Long live the People‚Äôs Biplob. 

Long live the Global Intifada.

__We are Westerners fighting for the total eradication of Western civilization. We stand in full solidarity with every movement for liberation in the Global South. Our Intifada is an internationalist one‚Äîwe are fighting for nothing less than the liberation of all people. We reject every genocidal, eugenicist regime that seeks to undermine the personhood of the colonized.

As the fascism ingrained in the American consciousness becomes ever more explicit and irrefutable, we seek community and instruction from militants in the Global South, who have been on the frontlines in the fight against tyranny and domination which undergird the imperialist world order.

**‚ÄúBiplob Cholbe‚Äù (Revolution must continue)**
__
As we, the militants of Hind‚Äôs Hall, continue our fight for Palestine from within the belly of the beast, we draw inspiration not only from the Palestinian resistance but from every struggle for liberation across the globe. This week, we are inspired by the student protesters of Bangladesh as they wage a People‚Äôs Biplob (Revolution) against the autocratic Awami League‚Äîa party that has retained absolute power under prime minister Sheikh Hesina since 2009.

While the Awami League employs counter-revolutionary violence to suppress dissent, working class students have led a seismic Biplob in the Global South. In the week since the protests began, the fascist Awami League has deployed nine thousand members of the Border Guard Bangladesh, a paramilitary force responsible for the nation‚Äôs border security, into streets across the country. The BGB‚Äîwith the aid of police goons, armed forces trained by the US and the EU, and the ruling party‚Äôs student wing the Chhatra League‚Äîhave murdered hundreds of protesters across the country. Nonetheless, the student movement has resisted and prevailed. Through direct action, they have set fire to the nation‚Äôs central propaganda network, the national broadcaster BTV. They achieved a major victory last Sunday, when the government rolled back the job quotas that were designed to keep Hasina in power.

The unwavering determination of Bangladeshi students and working class people sets a global precedent that we must incorporate into our actions for Palestine and against state repression. After Hasina broadcasted messages denouncing the Biplob, insulting protesters and calling them ‚Äútraitors,‚Äù actionists set fire to the state broadcasting network‚Äôs headquarters. When the Awami League responded with further repression, cutting off internet access for five days and imposing a curfew with ‚Äúshoot-on-sight‚Äù orders for anyone in noncompliance, the protesters refused to relent or negotiate. Instead, they directly resisted by breaking curfew, storming a jail and releasing over 800 inmates, and setting fire to the prison, government offices, and state vehicles. This is the only way to respond to state repression. As the movement for Palestine faces draconian censorship and counter-insurgency in the States, we must learn from our comrades in Bangladesh and continue to escalate until the empire crumbles.

The People‚Äôs Biplob in Bangladesh is a crucial piece of the universal struggle against American imperialism. It is the Intifada. And just as the Palestinian resistance escalated the Intifada on October 7th, it is now the people of Bangladesh who are escalating the global battle for liberation. By directly confronting military and police en masse, by not merely ‚Äúengaging‚Äù but battling fascist agitators, by dismantling state infrastructure, they are moving the global resistance into a new phase of struggle. Those of us in the Western world have the obligation to meet them there.

""**When this phase of the genocide in Gaza began, we were moved to direct action against weapons companies** because we knew that no ""democratically-elected"" official would listen to those of us crying out to stop the slaughter in Palestine - that to do so would mean interrupting endless streams of profit and sacrificing hold over the entire globe from the proxy state and military outpost named ""Israel."" **The only way to put a stop to the most horrific thing we'd ever witnessed was to make business as usual impossible, to lie our bodies on the cogs of the machine** that manufactures not only genocide around the globe, but mass consent for it among our own people. **And that is exactly why we championed the fight against Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons manufacturer. The extreme repression we faced from the state afterwards forced us into silence**, but now, as Kamala Harris makes one of her first public appearances since securing the Democratic nomination here in my hometown of Pittsfield, my continued silence feels only like complicity in the suffering of humankind everywhere.

Late July 24, we entered the parking area of NYPD's Strategic Response Group in Brooklyn and put sharp metal objects under multiple pigs' personal vehciels. Any of those pigs getting off work would have been met with the unpleasant surprise of punctured tires as they started for home.

This happened on the same day the NYPD sent 200 outside agitators to DC to protect genocidal war criminal Netanyahu and the U.S. imperialist mission.

Casey's support team has made sure that they have some funds on their commissary account upon arrival back at Santa Rita.

If you wish to help keep money on Casey's books, there are several ways to do this:
- At the jail via the TouchPay kiosk in the lobby.
- Sending a money order in the mail. The money order must be made payable to ""Casey Goonan #UMF227"" and there must be no other material in the envelope. No cash or personal checks will be accepted.
- Online with a credit card via one of the vendor platforms run by GlobalTel such as accesscorrections.com or connectnetwork.com. You will have to create an account. If the platform offers different fund options, the fund you want to get Casey money for commissary is called the ""Trust Fund"".

**Fundraising**
In addition to making sure Casey has commissary funds, we are preparing to fundraise for Casey's legal representation. Stay tuned and on call for more info on fundraising.

Casey knows they have the support of their community and appreciates everyone who has shown up in court, written letters, sent literature, and expressed care and solidarity. This will be a long struggle, and we commit ourselves to it until Casey is free. Please join us!

Update 7/13/24
**
Thank you for your interest in supporting Casey!

Casey‚Äôs arrest and incarceration have obviously caused immense distress and disruption to Casey‚Äôs life. They have entered the belly of the beast! Yet their dedication to abolition, commitment to study, perseverance, humor and spirit continue to shine through despite their conditions.

**LEGAL UPDATE** 
Casey's state charges were dismissed and the case has been moved under federal jurisdiction.

One federal charge has been unsealed, a single count of arson, 18 U.S.C. 844(f)(1). If convicted, this charge alone could mean 5-20 years plus a quarter million dollar fine. We are anticipating that additional charges could follow. 

Last week, Casey was moved to SF County Jail to appear in court on outstanding warrants. The transfer forced Casey to spend over 24 hours in a holding cell without access to insulin, to endure several hours long bus rides while shackled, harassment from correction officers, sleep deprivation, and inadequate access to food needed to regulate their blood sugar.  These experiences were very disregulating and their mental and physical health have been fluctuating as a result.

They have just arrived back at Santa Rita/Alameda County Jail under federal custody. We anticipate that Casey will stay at Santa Rita for the foreseeable future as they await trial. We are hopeful that things will stabilize now that the recent rounds of transfers and unpredictable court appearances have settled down for the moment. 

In the move to SF and back to Santa Rita, Casey lost access to the books and mail that they had been sent while previously at Santa Rita. We are intending to look into getting their belongings returned, but in the meantime they would appreciate more books, zines and printed out news articles. Any excess or duplicate literature can be shared inside. 

Freeing Casey will likely be a long fight. Just as Casey has persistently for years cared for, supported, and struggled alongside incarcerated comrades, we aim to replicate these actions in solidarity with Casey as they continue their struggle from the other side of the wall. 

**WAYS TO SUPPORT

Write Casey**
With the case now being federal, Casey has a new PFN. Their mailing address is now: 

Casey Goonan  #UMF227
Santa Rita Jail 
5325 Broder Blvd
Dublin, CA 94568

Casey is excited to receive mail including updates on news and current affairs as they have been feeling cut off from the world. 

What not to write about: 
- Do not discuss the case. Casey is still pre-trial and receiving mail concerning their case can seriously endanger them. 
- Do not valorize Casey. They are a person and a member of our community, not a symbol or martyr. Casey isn't looking for praise, but rather to maintain correspondence.
- Do not write anything you wouldn‚Äôt want Fox News, a cop, or a judge to see. Assume that intelligence and law enforcement agencies are reading your letter.
- As you correspond with Casey, they may send requests aside from books or commissary. Please coordinate directly with Casey's Support Committee regarding additional asks. 

For those who have written Casey and have not heard back yet, Casey mentioned that they hadn't received any of the mail that was sent to them at Santa Rita after June 22nd. With Casey going in and out of different jurisdictional systems, it is likely that much of their mail has been lost, 'lost', or returned to sender. Casey also wants people to know that the mail system is very slow so it may take a while for people to hear back from them.

Here's Part 1 of their communiqu√© ([source](https://x.com/AshAgony/status/1812551105173483662)):

**Recently, Black Revolutionaries in Atlanta sent out a call for a Summer of Resistance, a sustained, militant, and decentralized campaign targeting the multitude of appendages of the settler-colonial so-called United States, its Zionist client government, and their many accomplices in promoting a genocidal agenda in Palestine that is killing tens of thousands**. 

In response, we turned our attention to the MTA and the touchless payment system, OMNY, that it is trying to shove down New Yorkers' collective throat. These machines represent a world in which we must trade away our privacy for the right to move about our own city. The existence of OMNY and the city's desire to phase out all other methods of payment is an obvious ploy to increase surveillance and further violate our communities by policing the main arteries of transit for everyday New Yorkers ‚Äî as if the subways weren't fucking crawling with police already.

**We smashed ten of these machines in multiple subway stations across the city. We estimate that this is equivalent to about $40,000 in damage**. OMNY is in part result of a contract between the MTA and Cubic Corporation, a sprawling multinational entity owned by the private equity firm Veritas Capital [9 W. 57th St.]

Veritas's portfolio also includes Peraton, which is working with the Department of Homeland Security to build HART. This advanced surveillance system will compile and centralize biometric and other data on nearly 300 million individuals, further facilitating  DHS's campaign of terror against immigrants and communities of color.

This database, of course, will soon be open to Zionist security forces through DHS's Enhanced Border Security Partnership, which promises rapid mutual biometric intelligence sharing among the Zionist entity, US, UK,  and EU. Veritas is invested in the oppressive technologies shoring up the imposed colonial borders that  have been constructed on Palestinian land and between the United States and Mexico, ripping apart traditionally Indigenous territories.

Here, at the margins, we see the extremity of state violence enacted against those it has decided to keep out by any means necessary, through both active violence‚Äîwhen the Zionist military murders Palestinians in cold blood‚Äîand passive, when US agents allow families to drown in the Rio Grande before their very eyes. These horrors are manifold, and Veritas is profiting from them. If your city has a public transportation system, it is likely to be linked to Cubic and Veritas. Chicago's Ventra system, London's Oyster, the Breeze  card in Atlanta, and countless other systems inside and outside of the US are all Cubic endeavors.

Your governments are selling you out to a private company that actively promotes the imperialist projects from  Palestine to Mexico. Why? In our view, they are rolling out an ever-more militarized version of the already extant police state. **Cops flooding the subway and National Guard bag-checks are only the beginning. They are relying on us growing accustomed to being controlled in every aspect of our lives, of us willingly giving up our privacy in exchange for their rotten idea of ""safety."" There is no safety under occupation, and we are indeed living on occupied territory.**

This action was done in line with the Palestinian Youth Movement's Mask Off Maersk campaign, as Maersk plays a direct role in committing and continuing the genocide of the people of Palestine. In the last nine months, Maersk has transported hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weapons components to the top 5 weapons manufacturers in the US for assembly. Without Maersk those weapons would not reach israel.

~~

June 27, Nike Building on Kalapuya Land, so-called eugene, oregon

In the early-morning hours of June 27, a group took it upon themselves to respond to a call to action to disrupt business as usual in so-called eugene. As this city focuses on the spectacle of the olympic track trials, we must remember that there will be no business as usual until Palestine is free.

**In mere minutes the atrocious, neon-orange, nike building got a makeover. Some windows were smashed, an inflatable entrance was slashed, and some red paint splattered on the walls. The group left a single tag reading ‚ÄúFree Gaza,‚Äù to make their intentions even more clear.**

While nike likes to pretend it is ‚Äúprogressive,‚Äù the company very actively supports genocide. Nike regularly sends athletic equipment to the isr*eli defense forces, and regularly contributes to isr*eli zionist organizations. Nike has funded and collaborated with isr*eli athletes and sports associations based in isr*el. This action is the least that they deserve.

As always, let this serve as a reminder that we can always take things into our own hands.

With Love, Rage, and Solidarity,

Free Palestine.

~

Early morning on June 27th, local Olympics targets that are symbols of imperialism, colonialism, and capitalism were attacked during the Olympic Track and Field trials, which serve to legitimize US & ""Israeli"" global terror and genocide. A University of Oregon mural on Franklin boulevard near the trials was redecorated with a paint-filled fire extinguisher and multiple spray-painted stencils to condemn the University's role in facilitating genocide abroad and forced displacement at home.

We will not tolerate complicity in genocide. Zionist and American fascism are laying waste to the Palestinian people who are refusing their disappearance with a bravery and steadfastness that we must uplift with our whole beings in action or else drown in the blood of our wavering inaction. The targets are everywhere. We have waited too long. We must take all necessary action against our genocidal state for liberation.

The horrors of genocide are not an isolated elsewhere but are ever-present in the concrete here and now. The Olympics, built on the blood, labor, and displacement of oppressed peoples everywhere, serve only to legitimize empire. In the tradition of Indigenous resistance to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, we say No Olympics on Stolen Land. In the tradition of the anti-fascist 1936 People's Olympiad, we say No Olympics of Fascist Terror. In the tradition of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics that spawned GILEE, a direct tie between the fascist US police and the fascist IOF, we say fuck your Olympics and Stop Cop City.

Here in Eugene, the Olympic trials bring an inordinate amount of gentrification, policing, and the violent evictions and forcible displacement of houseless people from public space. These imperialist incursions into our community are rapidly changing the landscape of this city, bringing only profits drenched in the blood of genocide and the violence of the state upon our own oppressed. There are no separate worlds. Resistance until victory!

**URGENT CALL TO ACTION: FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE FORCED DISPLACEMENT OF DEMOCRACY CENTER TENANTS! COME TO THE DC NOW! BRING A FRIEND AND WEAR A MASK!**

Activists have occupied the Cambridge Democracy Center in order to combat and resist the unilateral decision made by its NGO owners to shutter the space, implicitly in response to community opposition to their permitting Zionist organizations to use it as an organizing space. The DC has been a fixture of movement and political organizing in the city and its loss would be a crucial blow to the progressive ecosystem.

Since the decision was made to shutter the space, a committee of stakeholder organizations has attempted -- without success -- to pressure the owners (the Foundation for Civil Leadership, a nonprofit run by billionaire Ian Simmons) to negotiate with the community and turn the space over to the groups who have depended on it for over two decades. These tactics have had no effect. Only direct, militant struggle can ensure that the people can win their demands from enemies like Simmons and his ilk, members of the capitalist ruling class (regardless of their progressive veneer).

Yesterday morning, courageous militants did just that. They escalated the struggle, seizing control of the building and declaring it the People's Democracy Center, calling on all of us to stand with them and keep the space alive for future generations of organizers and artists who might call it home. It is our responsibility to answer their call and stand with our comrades.

**ALL OUT TO DEFEND THE OCCUPATION! LONG LIVE THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY CENTER!**

**PROTESTORS CONVERGE IN ATLANTA TO OPPOSE THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE**

With neither presidential candidate commited to ending genocide in Palestine or halting spread of ""Cop City"" training facilities, protestors argue the debate gives an illusory choice.

**What**: STOP THE DEBATE! PROTEST
**When**: Thursday, June 27, 2024 at 8pm Eastern
**Where**: Home Park (1015 Tumlin ST NW, Atlanta, GA)


**ATLANTA, GA** -- On Thursday, June 27th, people will converge in downtown Atlanta to protest the first 2024 presidential debate between Presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The Stop the Debate! protest follows waves of protests condemning the genocide in Palestine and the development of police militarization facilities (known as ""Cop Cities"") in Atlanta, New York City and other cities. Since October 7th, the Israel military has, with the support of United States military aid, killed at least 40,000 Palestinians, with at least 14,000 children dead and more than 20,000 missing. 

Haydee Anderson, an Atlanta resident and organizer with the Ad-hoc Committee to Stop the Debate, stated ""The U.S.-backed genocide in Palestine hinges on the rise of authoritarianism and police militarization in the U.S. It requires us to be passive, or to be made passive through fear, police violence, and political repression. But many in the U.S. are instead taking action."" 

The presidential debate is slated to air to millions of homes from CNN studios at the Ted Turner Campus (1050 Techwood DR NW, Atlanta, GA, 30318) in Atlanta. The debate comes as Mayor Andre Dickens faces widespread condemnation for anti-democratic practices toward the referendum to stop Cop City. The $100M police training facility under construction in Dekalb County would host tactical exchange with the Israeli military through the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange (GILEE) program. Yesterday, protestors occupied the office of Mayor Andre Dickens to demand he put Cop City on the ballot.

""It's ironic Atlanta is hosting the first presidential debate. Atlanta has been a laboratory for anti-democratic governance. For the last year, the City of Atlanta has blocked the referendum on Cop City at every possible turn, despite 116,000 Atlantans signing a petition to put the facility to a vote,"" said Jordan Wright, an Atlanta resident and member of the Ad-Hoc Committee to Stop the Debate. 

Since 2021, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and the Atlanta City Council have refused to heed over 30 hours of public comment in opposition to Cop City. The City has also stalled the referendum process, suppressing the petition through legal channels. Similarly, approval ratings, polls and protests alike demonstrate that Biden has failed to abide popular mandate on the Palestinian genocide. 

""What is the choice here? Most Americans are against US involvement, but Biden continued to arm and fund this war."" says Parker Morris, an Atlanta-area resident and voter. ""Those of us who desire freedom--worldwide, from Atlanta to Palestine and beyond--see no real differences between the two presidential candidates. To us, the election offers only the illusion of democracy.""

puma has long been known as a supporter and enabler of the Zionist israeli settler state. Despite years of pressure, puma still sells its goods in illegal israeli settlements. This genocide rages on, and puma profits off of stolen Palestinian land. Not on our watch.

We want the world to know how this self-proclaimed champion of international athletic solidarity is directly invested in the deaths of Palestinian athletes. We act in solidarity with the more than 200 Palestinian sports clubs who have called on puma to stop their support for israeli apartheid.

In memory of Aaron Bushnell, ""some anarchists"" set a fire at the Portland office of Parker-Hannifin, a key supplier of the US F-35 fighter jet squadron. The US has been sending these offensive weapons to israel.

[**Original post here**](https://rosecitycounterinfo.noblogs.org/2024/06/claim-of-responsibility-for-parker-hannifin-arson/):

__On June 4th, The Israeli Defense Ministry penned a deal to procure a third F-35 fighter jet squadron from the United States government. This deal totaling 3 billion dollars, financed by US military aid to Israel, would bring the Israeli Air Force‚Äôs F-35 fleet to 75 fighter jets. The F-35 considered to be the backbone of the Israeli airforce, has played a critical role in the IDF‚Äôs assault on Gaza, escalating Israel‚Äôs aim of the total destruction of Palestinian life within Israeli occupied territories.

So on the morning of June 9th, we started a fire at the Portland offices of Parker-Hannifin located at 6458 N. Basin Ave in the Mocks Bottom industrial area. The mainstream media did not report on this fire. The full extent of the damage is unknown.

Parker-Hannifin was targeted because they are a key supplier of the F-35 program. Parker‚Äôs Fluid Systems Division was selected to design and develop the F-35‚Äôs fuel system and onboard inert gas generating system. Parker subsidiaries also supply parts for the jet‚Äôs engine subsystem and airframe.

In 2022 Parker-Hannifin purchased UK based military arms manufacturer Meggitt. Meggitt exports military components to repressive regimes across the world including supplying the air data systems for Israel‚Äôs Apache Helicopter gunships.

The state of Israel relies heavily on weapons and materials shipped from the West to enact their genocidal policies in Gaza. As insurgents living within the so-called United States we are in a unique position to disrupt the supply chains and infrastructure that make this genocide possible.

In memory of Aaron Bushnell

Today in the SF Bay Area, someone was arrested during a multi-house raid conducted by local and federal agencies for their alleged connection to a series of direct actions committed in support of ending the siege and bombardment of Palestine.

**This person is currently being held on $1M bail** and is being charged with a string of felonies, including arson. They are accused of using improvised devices to start fires and damage property in retaliation for police brutality against Gaza solidarity encampments.

These actions are logical. The dedication of those who took them is righteous. **Even if the person arrested is innocent, the entire Palestine solidarity movement should be supporting them as if they truly did take bold and heroic actions to save millions of lives**.

If you do not think these actions are effective, or if you think they are not wise, you should still support the accused. The ethical content of these deeds is clear, and it is something we should all aspire to, tactics aside: selfless and urgent action to stop the war.

In the coming days, fundraiser information and other next steps will emerge from movement defense collectives in California. **We should all be uplifting them, and sharing them with our bases. We will defend those who fight! Free Palestine**.

phase two of the #Escalate movement heats up at u.c. berkeley with a construction site set on fire in broad daylight. this was done in retaliation for u.c.pd's violent assaults on vulnerable student demonstrators and to punish the university of kkkalifornia system for supporting the genocidal zionist-Israel entity. this was an autonomous initiative in concert with the current WEEK OF ACTION currently underway: operation campus flood.

call it mutual aid

at one p.m. this a f t e r n o o n, we torched large portions of a construction site in the middle of u.c. berkeley campus. OPERATION CAMPS FLOOD on u.c.b. kkkampus has began with:

- successful looting of a u.c.b supply building of thousands of dollars,
- the fire bombing of a u.c.b cop car,
- the experimental burning of dry grass hills on the interior of campus
- the torching of a building on the perimeter of the campus
and now
- the arson of a construction site (mostly construction materials, wood pallets, and massive dry bush area

x this was done to further retaliate against the u.c.pd for attacking students at u.c.s.c. and u.c.l.a.

x this was done as an autonomous (self-directed act) in concert with anyone who shows out to create liberatoratory _destruction_ until the u.c. system completely divests from the genocidal ""israeli"" settler nation-building project

x this was done in solidarity with all displaced peoples who were removed from people's park - criminalized survivors of genocide HERE

x this was done in retaliation for the u.c. berkeley administration's attack on the houseless community of berkeley - in retaliation for stealing the land called people's park

lastly

‚ô° this was done on father's day for all the palestinian fathers who have lost their children at the hands of the zionist and amerikkkan settler states

On June 8th 2024, the liberal and reformist organizations planned yet another rally, with speakers on stages, and a symbolic human ""red line"" around the White House. Thousands of dollars were raised and spent, money that could have gone to Gaza. This was yet another publicity stunt that posed no threat to the Zionist entity or the US empire, while falsely claiming to do so.

We decided to take action as autonomous Palestinians, Muslims, and accomplices who believe in upholding the Thawabet (Palestinian Red lines of struggle). Our goal for this action was to show our support for the Muqawama (Resistance) and to emphasize that the Resistance is the Red line of the Palestinian Liberation struggle.
...
Shortly after we arrived, the pigs tried to arrest someone. Many principled comrades immediately ran to de-arrest the victim of state violence. The people successfully de-arrested the comrade. During the de-arrest, several comrades were pepper sprayed by the pigs. Medics and other comrades gave medical attention to the brave comrades who put their bodies on the line. The de-arrest was a beautiful and powerful example of putting the phrase ""we keep us safe"" we so often hear, into actual practice.

After that, we proceeded to move to the front of the White House to burn multiple flags of both the Zionist entity and the US settler colony.
...
To the youth we say, continue learning and sharing about the Thawabet and the Resistance. Show up with pro-Resistance banners and make your own pro-Resistance chants. **Do NOT feel obligated to listen to the 3 letter orgs and NGOs. Do not let the Marshalls and peace police stop you and take measures to protect yourselves from them as you would the pigs and Zionists**. Do not join orgs that have been around for decades and have not achieved a single tangible thing to liberate us. **Instead, form Affinity Groups, practice good security culture and organize Autonomous Actions.**

As usual, there is subset of people in our communities who accuse those of us who go beyond ""peaceful"", reformist, bullshit parades and rallies, as being ""funded by Zionists"". The desire to still appeal to optics and respectability politics after 9 months of this genocide confirms only one thing to us - these members of our community are more interested in preserving their class status within US empire than putting any of their comforts or privileges on the line for Palestine. To them we say, get out of the way.

""Not only does ICL facilitate resource theft, and the burning of land and bodies in Palestine and Lebanon, it also has deep ties
to the world‚Äôs largest carbon emitter, the United States military. The US government contracted ICL to produce white phosphorus for the US Army under a 5-year, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, fixed-price contract worth $3,342,150.

There were reports of white phosphorus being shipped to Israel from a shipping service in Detroit, owned by ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. Notably, ZIM‚Äôs parent company is also the Israel Corporation.

ICL extracts its phosphates from stolen Palestinian land, which it provides to Bayer (Monsanto), which produces white phosphorus to the US military.

The American and Zionist flags were burned in protest of settler-colonial violence, dispossession, and genocide, from Turtle Island to Palestine.
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
The American empire is an active participant in the current genocidal onslaught, not only by funding and arming the Zionist entity, but with US military and intelligence presence in Gaza itself. The Zionist entity is an immoral and illegitimate state, built on the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and constructed as an outpost of Western imperialism.

The Palestinian people have suffered for far too long under the chokehold of Zionism, aided, abetted, and driven by the unquenchable thirst of American empire‚Äîbut we know that, through the steadfast resistance of the Palestinian people and the movement for Palestinian liberation around the world, Zionism will fall and Palestine will be free.

This action is part of a broader international escalation‚Äîundertaken in response to calls from Gaza‚Äîto hold accountable all entities that aid and abet the ongoing colonization of the Palestinian people. The Zionist entity relies on a network of puppet states, normalizers, and imperialist allies to maintain its brutal status quo. Other actions in New York City today targeted ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãthe U.S. Campaign on Palestinian Affairs, the German Consulate, and the Permanent Mission of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to the United Nations.

In a communique issued this morning, the New York City actionists write:
‚ÄúThrough our actions we continue to globalize the intifada. We locate complicity in the genocidal campaign against Palestinians among all nations who refuse to cut ties with the Zionist settler state, refuse to support Palestinian freedom and the right to return, and profit from the attempted annihilation of Palestinian people. We as dissidents in the imperial core urge comrades everywhere to consider all normalizers our enemies and join in creative resistance to every state actor and institution that aids and abets genocide.‚Äù

A group of autonomous actors targeted the German Consulate in New York City in the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, June 12. Actionists splashed blood-red paint on the exterior of the consulate and wheatpasted¬†an official-looking apology from the German government for their active participation in the Zionist entity's genocidal assault on Gaza.

The German state supplies 30% of the IOF's weapons and is the second-largest supporter of the Zionist entity, behind only the U.S. In 2023, Germany approved $320 million in military aid to the entity ‚Äî over ten times more than in 2022. Germany's generous funding has made this genocide possible. Meanwhile, German leaders have criminalized the Palestine solidarity movement, making mass arrests and cynically banning protests in the name of so-called antisemitism. In solidarity with pro-Palestinian movements in Germany, the actionists demand that Germany recognize the Palestinian State and support the recognition of an independent Palestinian state in the EU.¬†

This action is part of a broader international escalation‚Äîundertaken in response to calls from Gaza‚Äîto hold accountable all entities that aid and abet the ongoing colonization of the Palestinian people.

unity_of_fields,231,unity_of_fields,unity_of_fields,2024-06-11 17:52:49,"[Reported by IndyBay](https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2024/06/11/18867256.php): **4am -- 11 June 2024 -- Windows were smashed and a firebomb was allegedly lit at the Federal Building in downtown Oakland, as an act of retaliation for SFPD's violent siege on the Sidra's Sanctuary encampment at the SF Federal Building**. This act was therefore committed in solidarity with all peoples who were arrested at the city encampment, as well as in unity with the global axis of resistance and the protracted war for Palestine liberation and the decolonization of occupied lands. To learn more about the police attack and violent arrests of the most recent city encampment, check this out: https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2024/06/10/18867249.php

At around 4am this morning, two heavy rocks were thrown at the windows of the Oakland Federal Building and a firebomb was allegedly placed and lit outside of the window, in a row of bushes that spans the west side of the building. Allegedly, the window did not break completely when rocks were thrown at it, which seems to have limited what the insurgents could do with fire in the moment, so the device may have been placed in the bushes for this reason.

We assume the intended plan was to throw the incendiary device inside the building offices, but unfortunately, while the torch was being lit, a security officer ran out of nowhere and began to yell and chase after one of the insurgents. The insurgent got away quickly, evading three security guards in a full sprint. One person chasing the insurgent may have been a plain cloths officer lurking in their car. We are unsure if the firebomb caught hold of the building front, as there has been no news reportage yet of this retaliatory attack on the police State. But this was a clear message, if the State continue to harm protestors, campers, and anyone out in the streets fighting for Palestine liberation, then they will be faced with a decentralized, horizontal, and widespread solidarity movement that grows daily with every state aggression

When the pigs mess with our people we must retaliate to level the score. Redirect the violence back at the rulers and managers of global Settler Empire. We cannot allow anymore of our comrades and loved ones to get beat-to-shit, arrested, and harmed by the white supremacist U.S. government.

**The demands issued also helped prevent co-optation. **They were:
**
1. Free Palestine

2. Abolish the University

3. Land Back

4. Fuck gentrification

5. Fuck 12
**
Following the logic that making demands pushes movements and insurrections toward negotiation and moderation, and leaning into the observation that there is no centralized authority capable of granting us the world we insist on building (without abolishing itself...) the demands are maximalist, general, uncompromising, and reject incremental logic. They challenge respectability and the demands-based framework itself, making it harder for liberal organizations to claim credit for the energy or power built by the action.

**(5) On student radicalization -- learning by doing.**

Student organizations limit imagination of possible actions and control protests into being governable, peaceful, and nonviolent. Often, the heads of these organizations are obsessed with the idea that they are responsible for keeping a crowd safe and are willing to police the actions of others in the name of preventing arrest. When not intentionally challenged, the campus bubble of student organizing can isolate students from non-student genocide resisters, which means isolation from collective knowledge of resistance techniques.

While the encampments did allow for some new networks to be formed and more militant tactics to be shared, some organizers were more interested in control than in escalation. This desire for control played out along racial lines, as students in the encampements policed Black protestors and failed to understand the reality of police violence.

In addition to more methods to occupy, defend, and evade, this action also led students to think about the question of demands. Traditional organizing encourages creating ""achievable"" divestment demands and other institutional reforms. But students are seeing that demands and appeasement reforms don't go far enough. The full disruption of the University's ties to occupation, genocide and imperialism requires the abolition of the University institution.

The Casbah of Basel al-Araj showed students that they can take actions which threaten power and that they can do so without the permission of a central organization. Students saw that actions do not have to end in performative arrest. We lose our ability to attack if we all go to jail. Risking capture can be done with strategy and material impact, but being captured is¬†not¬†the goal.

At the Casbah, the possibility of autonomous action and militant escalation was not just theoretical. Students and non-students joined in by building barricades, covering for people exiting IOP, kettling the cops, joining other actions throughout the day, and opposing co-optation.

**CONCLUSION**",MessageMediaWebPage,False,Not Available,None,[],[],39,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/188,1669.0,9.0,No Replies
unity_of_fields,187,unity_of_fields,unity_of_fields,2024-06-04 18:08:35,"Leaving the building so quickly was not the only way things could have unfolded. Had the front door barricade held, or had protestors blockaded more successfully from outside, UCPD cops would not have entered the building so quickly, and protestors could have remained inside longer. This would have necessitated longer-term organizing from supporters outside the building, and perhaps a different police response. By the time police entered the building, it might not have been possible for protestors to exit into a friendly crowd; leaving in handcuffs was thus a possibility protestors likely anticipated.

However, the protestors at Casbah of Basel Al Araj had no apparent interest in symbolic arrests, and seized the opportunity to leave when pigs breached the building and an escape route presented itself. This flexibility, and mental preparation to leave if possible rather than submit to forms of ""surrender"" and planned arrests, was a strategic strength.¬†¬†

**(2) On scouting, preparation & logistics - practice more**.

At the Casbah, cops were able to move relatively quickly through barricades protestors attempted on the building's doors. Had there been more materials on site for back-up barricades‚Äîor more knowledge on site about methods of barricading doors‚Äîprotestors might have been able to improvise stronger barricades and hold the space for longer. Practicing skills routinely, to be more ready to act in escalated action situations and to pivot on the fly when plans change, is an evergreen takeaway that's especially relevant at actions where success hinges on specialized techniques and tactics.

Further, having more supplies on site for the full range of possible scenarios would've served the action well. Tents, chairs, food, and more defensive materials didn't arrive on site as soon as they could have, which delayed the crowd's ability to jump in and support holding the space.

**(3) On Identifying Cop Tactics‚ÄîRepression goes beyond arrests**.

The fact that no arrests were made is always something to celebrate. However, it's important not to reduce state repression to a single tactic. Cops may not have taken anyone away on the day of the protest, but they did stand by with body cameras recording footage throughout, and at several moments pointed out specific individuals within the crowd, seeming to single them out for increased attention.¬†We can't be sure why specific people were pointed out. The cops could be noticing people arrested in previous protests, they could be trying to identify potential organizers of an action, or mapping networks to see who might know each other. Observing these practices underscores the importance of disguising identities when in action spaces, and having a robust threat model. For all we know, arrests could be attempted weeks after an action using footage of people involved, as we saw in 2020 in Chicago after a protest in Grant Park where a statue of Col*mbus used to stand. ¬†

**(4) On liberal co-optation -- strong principles set the tone**.

This action aimed to disrupt the pattern of liberals deescalating confrontational tactics through peace policing. So, we created principles of unity that included escalation, self-defense, non-cooperation with the state, and diversity of tactics. We shared those principles through fliers handed out to the crowd before the march, and through announcing them over the megaphone at the rally outside the Casbah.",MessageMediaWebPage,False,Not Available,None,[],[],35,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/187,1416.0,9.0,No Replies
unity_of_fields,186,unity_of_fields,unity_of_fields,2024-06-04 18:08:35,"Meanwhile, the crowd outside was trying to prevent cops from entering the building but did not succeed in blocking pigs from going up the porch stairs to the front door. Once the pigs got to the front door, it only took them a few hard yanks to break the barricade's pull on the front door.¬† From there, the protestors regrouped to the second floor and tried to barricade that floor. As pigs started to enter the second floor, the protestors retreated to a small conference room, and held off the pigs for long enough to leave the building through windows and onto a porch roof. Just as the cops were able to enter the room, everyone escaped onto the roof and climbed down into the crowd. From there,¬†people were able to escape using the cover of the crowd. No arrests were made.

As police worked to enter the building, protestors outside had set up barricades in the gangway between the IOP and a neighboring building, making it harder for cops to move between the front and back yards. After protestors made their escape and active clashes with cops slowed down, people began to set up tents and chairs on the front lawn of the building, and continued to occupy space in the back yard as well. Food and snacks arrived, attempts were made to set up a speaker system (though cops threw a wrench in this plan by cutting an extension cord), and kids played on the lawn. The demands of the action and the principles guiding it were read aloud.

Struggles with police occurred in the building's backyard, as cops attempted to control the space and warned that arrests would be made if any more tents were set up. A nearby frat blasted shitty music (the national anthem and mediocre dad rock with a quick reprieve in the form of Dolly Parton's 9 to 5), trying to drown out protestors' chants. Protestors continued to surround the building and hang out until around 9:30 PM, at which point protestors assessed that there was not enough energy, support, or numbers to spend the night amid cops' threats to start making arrests. The group marched to the University president's house nearby with chants of ""we'll be back.""

**TAKEAWAYS**

We share these takeaways in an effort to contribute to tactical and strategic knowledge developing across campuses, as solidarity encampments have been set up, attacked, repressed, voluntarily disbanded, and in some cases escalated. We hope this can be useful to others pursuing escalated tactics in solidarity with Gaza and in resistance to colonial violence at home and far away.

**(1) On escapes and exits‚Äîhope for the best & prep for the worst**.
Protestors who entered to barricade the IOP were able to make a full escape‚Äîfootage shows them climbing safely from the roof into the waiting arms of friends. It wasn't clear in advance that this would be possible, but folks inside were quick on their feet and had the foresight to leave to fight another day.

The University of Chicago's campus is highly policed by the private University of Chicago Police Department (UCPD) and the municipal Chicago Police Department (CPD), so drawing enough protestors to fend off an initial police response was going to be difficult, especially during Alumni Weekend when police presence was already heightened. UCPD responded most actively to the protest, quickly moving past protestors attempting to block the front steps; removing furniture blocking the front door; shoving protestors and throwing chairs at them; and then entering and sweeping the building. CPD officers set up lines on all sides of the building, but mostly sat back and watched events unfold, after initially chasing some protestors who attempted to barricade the alley behind the building back into the crowd.",MessageMediaWebPage,False,Not Available,None,[],[],40,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/186,1443.0,8.0,No Replies

**CONTEXT**

Since October 7th, Chicago has seen countless marches and actions that have been successful in bringing out hundreds and thousands of people. However, many of these numbers consist of suburbanites driving or being bussed into the city to show support, rather than a mass of Chicagoans coming together from across the deeply race- and class-segregated city. In addition, these marches have usually been put on by a small number of nonprofit organizations. They have been heavily marshaled and largely symbolic, leaving many people demoralized and looking for more.

As every day sees more Gazans murdered by the zionist entity, symbolic parades that play into respectability politics at every turn and ask the state for permission to protest are clearly a toothless and insufficient response. Small, isolated acts of sabotage aren't enough either‚Äîit is crucial to seek more militant forms of collective action. These actions should demonstrate an understanding of the throughline between the colonial states of the US and Israel, and the need to abolish both entirely‚Äîprisons, police, military, and state bureaucracies alike‚Äîto stop both the genocide in Gaza and the daily forms of state violence here in Chicago. From within the imperial core, there's an obligation to interrupt the material support that the ""U.S."" provides ""israel.""

In order to encourage more militant collective action, there is a need for a change in protest culture that is rife with peace policing liberal concerns about ""outside agitators."" Contrary to what peace police, protest managers, and the heads of liberal social justice organizations would have us believe, many people are looking to take more escalated action and learn the skills to do so together. This desire clearly expressed itself in flashes at the campus encampments here in Chicago, including in the brief but impactful establishment of the Casbah of Basel Al Araj on the University of Chicago campus.

**SUMMARY OF EVENTS**

Around 4:40 pm on Friday, May 17th, as the University of Chicago's Alumni Weekend kicked off, a group of protestors marched to the Institute of Politics on the University of Chicago campus. Soon after they arrived, a group entered the building and barricaded its entrances from the inside. Banners were dropped from the upstairs windows. Staff working in the building were told that the building was being occupied and it was time for them to leave. Most of the building's occupants complied, but the director of the institute, who happened to be a former senator, refused to leave. Cops were able to breach a first-floor door on the side of the building that led to the basement, but protestors prevented them from accessing the inside of the building for the time being.",MessageMediaWebPage,False,Not Available,None,[],['https://t.me/pal_actionus/113)'],60,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/185,1578.0,12.0,No Replies

The device was lit underneath the back left wheel of a police SUV, placed between the tire and underside of fuel tank. There were too many people around at the time to see the final result. Unsure if it caught the tire and fuel tank. But the device has enough fuel in it  to torch the entire car if it was successfully placed.

This act was done in retaliation against UCPD, for their attack on students yesterday on a different campus and to retaliate against the University of California for its support for the zionist israel settler colony. More specifically ‚Äì this attempt to torch a police car in front of the university was in solidarity with our Palestinian siblings assaulted by the zionist state in Rafah. It came from a place of love for Palestine, and love for revolution and liberation of all oppressed people.

This act was:
In solidarity with the students attacked by the fascist police state at uc santa cruz. In solidarity with the students attacked by zionist street collaborators at uc los angeles. In solidarity with the uc berkeley students seizing the time and taking back Hines Hall.

In solidarity with the resistance axis for Palestinian life, liberation, and total decolonization of the zionist occupied lands. For an end to the genocide of our beloved Palestine, and an end to the anti-Black and colonial genocide destroying our loved ones here.

A life worth living is a life in solidarity with our Palestinian siblings, who face down the settler‚Äôs scope with every movement, or every day.  A life worth living is a life in solidarity with the Ohlone people. We continue to return the land with this offering. A life worth living is in solidarity with our Black and Brown siblings continuously surviving and thriving in the face of genocidal state violence here in the Bay Area.

An appeal issued by the Palestinian student movement in the Gaza Strip

To the global student movement to stop the genocidal war

It is time for revolutionary escalation of the global student intifada for Palestine

We write this call from our student movement in the Gaza Strip, from the heart of occupied Palestine, from under the brutal Zionist bombing, explosions, and the clutches of the monstrous nightmare of death that lurks around us in every corner, house, and street. We raise it from prison cells, from beneath the destruction, and from inside the rubble, to send it to our fellow students, our comrades,  brothers and sisters, in all the universities, schools and institutes of the world everywhere, and we address the global student movement that was launched in order to stop the genocidal war that is being engineered and financed by the governments of the United States, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and others, this courageous student movement that was born in the universities as an integral part of our struggle, that expresses the conscience of students and peoples who yearn for justice and freedom.

We in the Gaza Strip look at you with pride and honour, as you are a revolutionary fighting vanguard, and a natural and integral part of our Palestinian liberation movement. You have come in a resounding, honest and clear response against the Israeli massacres and those who finance them, confronting the companies of the Zionist war of genocide and ethnic cleansing that have claimed the lives of thousands of Palestinian students of all ages, including hundreds of struggling Palestinian student cadres, wounded and imprisoned, in addition to our great loss in the martyrdom of our professors and teachers, and the destruction of our universities, institutes and schools.",MessageMediaPhoto,False,Not Available,None,[],"['https://masarbadil.org/en/2024/05/4792/)', 'https://masarbadil.org/en/2024/05/4792/)']",98,https://t.me/unity_of_fields/158,11679.0,62.0,No Replies

On this so-called ‚ÄúMemorial Day,‚Äù a US Army & Navy Recruiting & Career Center was targeted in Downtown Brooklyn in memory of all martyrs of Gaza & all the courageous people of the world who sacrificed their lives resisting US imperialism. Doors were locked shut, blood red paint was sprayed across the front facade of the building, & ‚ÄúRAFAH‚Äù and ‚ÄúGAZA‚Äù were written on the windows, along with red triangles.

The genocide in Gaza is a joint US-Israeli project, and the US military must be held accountable for it. Yesterday, the IOF accelerated their bombardment of Rafah by decapitating children & burning dozens of people alive with American-made bombs and jets. As the Israeli Occupation‚Äôs military dominance continues, the US will only expand & explore its military role in Palestine. The horrors we are witnessing today are a rehearsal for the future that the US military & its partners envision for people of the world.

The US military has done far more than kill people; it also destroyed the land, torching precious jungles & wildlife, ravaging farms with chemical weapons, & contaminating rivers and coastlines.

**THERE IS NO FUTURE WITH THE US MILITARY!
THERE IS NO FUTURE WITHOUT GAZA!**

Recruitment centers play a vital role in maintaining the genocide economy by targeting the working class and transforming them into killers. But much like the pigs in NY, the military is struggling with recruitment because the people are waking up to the true nature of these institutions. **This is a crisis we must work to exacerbate.

Wednesday, May 15th, Kalapuya land, so-called eugene.

Before dawn, an autonomous group smashed the windows of a local starbucks, leaving only ‚ÄúFree Gaza‚Äù and ‚ÄúLand Back‚Äù written in paint. This action was taken to bring awareness to the genocide taking place in Gaza and to interrupt business-as-usual. This act of vengeance was carried out on May 15th, Nakba Day, a day recognizing the ongoing genocide and forced displacement of Palestinians.

Starbucks has repeatedly shown its hostility towards Palestinian liberation, and did so most recently when it sued its workers‚Äô union for posting a statement in support of Palestine on social media. The economy of eugene is complicit in the genocide happening in Gaza; the university and multi-national corporations profit off imperialism while making the city unaffordable for the majority of people there. While starbucks isn‚Äôt playing a central role in the genocide the israeli miliary is waging, starbucks is symbolic of an amerikkkan psyche and economy that feeds off imperialism. The chain is a tell tale sign of gentrification and a staple of the white middle and upper middle class. We won‚Äôt stand aside and let the amerikkkan economy continue unabated when it‚Äôs a system founded on and actively fueling colonialism and genocide.

This was done by a group of autonomous antifascists who echo the words of the anti-zionists that shut down the ‚ÄúFriends of the IDF‚Äù gala:

We have no name. We are not an organization. We are not an entity. Do not try to find us. We are everywhere and we will not stop.

Palestine will be free.

**The BDS National Committee's Statement on Armed Resistance Contradicts Our People's Legitimacy in Practicing Resistance and Ignores Consensus
**
We have followed the stance presented in the [statement](https://bdsmovement.net/Supporting-Student-Led-Solidarity-Mobilizations-In-Their-Demands) by the [""BDS National Committee"" (BNC),](https://web.archive.org/web/20221103111937/https://jisrcollective.com/pages/a-tactic-not-a-trademark.html) issued in English, regarding the required stance on armed resistance by solidarity movements with our people.

We in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine reject the call made in the statement and appreciate all the positions, forces, and individuals expressing their support for Palestinian resistance in facing the genocidal and colonial zionist war.

The Front considers that clearly expressing support for our people's right in Gaza does not contradict the call to end the genocide and support resistance in all its forms, including revolutionary armed struggle.

The Front noted that boycott committees spread worldwide, especially in Europe and the Americas, are a broad movement involving all Palestinian institutions, supporters of the Palestinian people, and solidarity committees. They are not linked to the BNC in Ramallah and do not take orders or decisions from it.

The Front emphasized that the justifications of the BNC in Ramallah and its call for silence on armed resistance in Western countries are inaccurate positions and far from reality, because the Palestinian presence and solidarity movements with the Palestinian people are all targeted by the allies of the zionist entity, accused of ""anti-Semitism"" regardless of whether they adopt this slogan or that.

The Front concluded its statement by noting that attempts by some parties to neutralize the adherence to the slogan of armed resistance weaken the Palestinian national struggle and the legitimacy of armed resistance fighting on the soil of the homeland. It ignores the support and consensus of millions of supporters worldwide for this struggle, method, and slogan. Palestinian armed resistance and resistance factions in the region have become an icon and source of inspiration for all free people globally. The slogan ""From the river to the sea... Palestine will be free"" has become the central slogan echoed by revolutionaries worldwide.

LOCKHEED MARTIN KILLS!
FUCK THE CEO JAMES TAICLET!

**Early in the morning of May 15, in commemoration of Nakba Day and in honor of all the martyrs murdered by Lockheed Martin weapons, an autonomous group targeted the NYC residence of the CEO James Taiclet, located at 139 Wooster Street in Soho. The entrance was splattered with red paint as blood and messages of ‚ÄúLockheed Martin kills‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck the CEO James Taiclet‚Äù were written on the exterior.**

Lockheed Martin is the worlds largest imperialist weapons manufacturer, and it supplies the IOF with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles as well as F-16 and F-35 fighter jets that are being used extensively to bomb Gaza. From Iraq, to Afghanistan, to Yemen, to the US-Mexico Border, Lockheed Martin commits global genocide funded by billions of the US government tax dollars. Lockheed Martin has nothing but a legacy of death and destruction around the world. In an October 17 investor meeting, James Taiclet (the chairman, president, and CEO of Lockheed Martin) bragged that the genocide in Gaza would be a ‚Äúpotential driver for increased revenue in the coming years.‚Äù

As we witness another Nakba onfolding, this action is a reminder that war criminals live amongst us, and a warning to all genocide profiteers:

...**The University does not simply fund Israel, it creates Israel**, and launches this white-colony into the post-modern Empire. What does divestment mean when the very essence and foundation of the institution is a fascist regime? Where does Zionism begin and end in the University of California? Is divestment an oxymoron? The UC must be abolished.

The ""working-class"" public colleges are not safe from critique (nor attack). Some of the resulting encampments have established themselves as outposts of nonprofits and NGOs -loyal only to funders; moved by professional partnerships and personal brands. **Revolutionary struggle and its legacies have been co-opted, deradicalized, and professionalized through identity-driven liberal pedagogies**. By teaching a revisionist history that renders liberation movements compatible with capitalism, university-deputized counterinsurgents erase and demonize militant forms of struggle while smugly promoting an inert philosophy of nonviolence and respectability. This is one of many reasons why, **although divestment is a valid and tangible baseline demand, our long-term focus should not be on reforming and reaffirming these institutions, but rather on resource expropriation and fucking them up irreparably**.

Across Bay Area university encampments and police-liasoned street mobilizations, **escalation is consistently policed by weaponized liberal anti-oppression politics or crushed entirely by the fear of risk. Perpetual hand wringing over what could happen obscures what can be achieved**. Attempting to shape a militant movement into something that will never have to contend with repression is to abandon the pursuit of revolutionary ends. The attack on UCOP began with an ask: how can political analysis be articulated through attack? An effective operation begins with the needs of the struggle, the goals of the cadre, and its limitations. Threat assessments should remain realistic and specific to the actions being carried out. Within the American empire, what is solidarity with the Mujahideen of Palestine and militant student movements if not shapeshifting into a political fighting force?

**We join the chorus calling for escalation in the imperial core: escalate, escalate, escalate!** This is our historical and spiritual duty. To not hold this as truth is to give up and accept defeat, hoping someone else will do what it takes to disrupt the flow of capital into the settler-colonial project. **We must bring the war home.

- Basel al-Araj

With the Aurora Borealis above us and the martyrs in our hearts, we attacked the UC Office of the President in solidarity with the Palestinian Resistance. **Using a fire extinguisher filled with red paint we covered the facade and smashed seven windows. Then, with access to the building, we released 500 cockroaches inside and emptied a second fire extinguisher onto the interior**. We finalized the act by leaving a water jug inscribed with ""Bonk"" at the scene - an homage to the militants of Cal Poly Humboldt and the international student encampment movement.

As anti-colonial anarchists and communists we offer this act of material and spiritual solidarity with the hopes of shattering the illusion that resistance is limited to a single site.

As Moten says ‚ÄúTHE ONLY POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE UNIVERSITY TODAY IS A CRIMINAL ONE‚Äù. The University‚Äôs true fascist form has been put on full display, and hiding behind hollow progressive ideals is no longer an option for the dead-eyed desk killers. Abolish the UC showed us in 2020 that the University of California is nothing more than a settler colonial project, that their police are protecting the gates of colony, where knowledge is produced and captured by the State to only dig its claws deeper into the flesh of Indigenous lands here and abroad. Let us not forget the UC became co-ed to breed settlers and populate the west coast. Speaking only to the UC's material connection to the Zionist entity obfuscates the extent of the political, theoretical, and cultural entanglements between the UC and the Israeli State...**

**1. Escalate for Gaza**. The intensity of human suffering in Gaza calls for an intensification of our struggle to stop it. We will not disavow any actions taken to escalate the struggle, whether they be hunger strikes or militant direct action.


**2. We stand with our communities**. The distinction between student and non-student only enforces the gates between the university and its surrounding communities. By rejecting this difference we break open the gates.


**3. We won‚Äôt get bored**. The Nakba Day protests will develop our collective intelligence and expand our capacity for action. We will be ready to fight back when attacked.

**4. No one speaks for us, we speak with our actions**. No one person or organization can represent any protest. We encourage autonomous action aligned with the goals of the broader movement.


**5. We will stop at nothing less than total liberation**. Anyone making excuses for de-escalation at this time is betraying the Palestinian people. If protests in your city are only encouraging passive ""awareness"" of the genocide and not direct action against it, call your own demonstration!

To stop the genocide, we must move from a student movement to an international liberation movement, from encampments to
widespread social unrest.

Bring the gears of the US-zionist war machine to a grinding halt. This means blocking its supply chains and hosting street demonstrations that pose a real threat to any political stability in the US so long as it is propped up by genocide.

**The movement for Palestine
must also be a movement
against the police.**

Police departments maintain the interests of genocidal politicians and corporate elite locally, while the U.S. and zionist armed forces maintain them on an international scale. All successful movements for Palestine will encounter some police response because our strength scares them. Prepare for this, but do not let anxieties that you are not prepared enough defer action.

The liberators of Hind's Hall at Columbia University released the communiqu√© as a call to action for the movement to keep escalating. ""Columbia escalated, so we did too."" Read the [**full piece here**](https://thenewinquiry.com/from-harlem-to-palestine-globalize-the-intifada/), and excerpts below:

__Who are we? Some of us are students under the threat of expulsion. Others are staff, faculty, alumni, and community members. However, inside of Hind‚Äôs Hall, none of these distinctions mattered. To liberate the building was to tear down the artificial border between ‚Äústudent‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-student‚Äù imposed by the classist, racist sorting mechanism which determines who deserves a place within the ivory tower and who remains locked outside its gates.__..

__Off of campus and into the streets.

The enemy may have dismantled our communes, but we know our struggle has only just begun. Just as the Vietnamese revolutionaries ignited the cycle of student revolt in ‚Äò68, the Palestinian people inspire us to continue building on the insurrectionary energy incubated in the encampments. The Student Intifada will become a revolutionary force only when it succeeds in integrating itself with the struggles of the surrounding community and expands the popular cradle of resistance beyond the campus and into the streets.

What we experienced is nothing compared to what the Palestinian people have endured for 76 years and seven months. Bombs on schools, missiles on hospitals, state-of-the-art machines designed to slaughter children by the hundreds and dissolve the skin from their faces, bulldozers and mass graves, starvation, dehydration, imprisonment, torture, displacement, death‚Äîthis will be our legacy, unless those of us within the belly of the beast fight to end it.

We chose action, and you must too‚Äîagain, again, until the weight of our collective action and refusal dismantles the prisons and all our prisoners flood the streets.

With each passing day, more Israeli bombs are falling on Gaza. Over a million Palestinians have been displaced from their homes. The world is bearing witness to a genocidal military campaign to clear out Gaza once and for all. As leaders in the West continue to stand by Israel‚Äôs outrageous crimes, activists and people of conscience around the world are using direct action to take matters into their own hands and disrupt the war machine themselves. Palestine Action is one such group that is strategically targeting direct disruptive actions at production sites of Elbit Systems Ltd. and its subsidiaries. Elbit Systems is an Israel-based weapons technology and defense company supplying the Israeli military with the instruments of sophisticated carnage whose deadly force is being unleashed upon Palestinians as we speak. TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with Fergie Chambers, Max Geller, and Calla Walsh of Palestine Action.

üßµ**HIGHLIGHTS**:

We‚Äôre an affinity network. So it‚Äôs not like us as the folks who were the founding organizers are coordinating everything everyone does or telling people to go break the law somewhere. We‚Äôre an affinity network. We share ideas, we share an affinity for direct action and an opposition to the occupation, and specifically this ongoing genocide. So people have come up in that network, and at least half a dozen times that Cambridge location has been targeted in one way or another.

And this is what we‚Äôre really asking, or what we‚Äôre hoping for is that people take up these tactics in regional chapters everywhere in the country where Elbit is, that we develop focused targeting of other targets, especially west of the Mississippi where Elbit is not, but focus targets. Because if we just hit Raytheon and Boeing and BlackRock and The New York Times and every other day, we‚Äôre not mounting a strategic campaign. Again, people are using the language of ‚Äúshut it down‚Äù a lot, which, in my experience, really started around the Ferguson moment about 10 years ago, that let‚Äôs shut it down because people were shutting down commerce to shed light on police violence.

In the movement since then, we hear ‚Äúshut it down‚Äù every time someone holds a sign up. And it‚Äôs valiant to go into places to harass senators, to list names. But in the end, we‚Äôre still not really challenging power in a direct way that, as Max illustrated, is affecting their operations, affecting their bottom line, affecting their ability to process the war machine and make money off of it.

So we‚Äôre really hoping, without even giving our opinion on the strategic or political developments that should or shouldn‚Äôt happen with the US government, we‚Äôre saying we want to take very direct material action against the complex that enables this genocide and the US empire broadly. So it‚Äôs not just one action, and it‚Äôs not just one type of action, but it‚Äôs action that‚Äôs meaningful, and it‚Äôs action that is bringing into focus why we‚Äôre doing the action, and not the risks being taken by the people doing the actions, not the legal battles they get into. That‚Äôs not the story. We‚Äôre comfortable. We should be less comfortable. And that‚Äôs the way we see this.

.....I think the most important point to highlight is that Elbit‚Äôs stocks have been dropping consistently since Oct. 7, while every other major defense contractor‚Äôs stocks are skyrocketing, and that is because of the relentless direct action campaign. Every time we shut down a factory, even for a few hours, it costs Elbit time, money, and resources. Even if we‚Äôre a few people throwing paint at a building, the top executives of Elbit are freaking out when that happens, especially when, as happened in the US a few days ago, three locations in different states are hit by different groups all in one night.""

Israel is using Elbit drones, bullets, technology, and internationally-banned white phosphorous to commit genocide against Palestine right now.

üßµ Read our statement: Why Target Elbit?
**
Every hour, we receive thoughtful, well-aimed suggestions or inquiries about alternate targets for direct action: political offices, Embassies, NGOs, other weapons companies, intersections, etc., all of which have clear ties to the Zionist occupation of Palestine, and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.

It is right and just to rebel and act boldly in all places and moments, with all tactics, without a doubt. The more chaos ensues in the halls and courtyards of the normalizers and genocidaires, the better. 

But focus in targeting, from a strategic perspective, is the most effective route, which is why our campaign is singularly focused on Elbit Systems, Israel‚Äôs *largest* weapons producer.

Palestine Action US has been given the privilege of carrying the banner of one of the Western world‚Äôs most successful grassroots direct action campaigns. Palestine Action UK, founded over three years ago by a Palestinian-Iraqi woman, has successfully shut down two of Elbit‚Äôs UK locations, permanently, and got HSBC to divest from Elbit. Their pressure has escalated over the years into a constant, relentless campaign, to the point where we see disruptions at Elbit in the UK nearly every day. Since October 7th, that pressure has only grown, and also exploded into the US, Canada, Australia, and everywhere Elbit is headquartered. In that time, while other weapons firms‚Äô profits have skyrocketed, Elbit shares have taken a nosedive.

If one wishes to help build a city, one must first build a house, so others might see how it was built. Like other historic campaigns which have isolated the enablers of injustice, we start with Elbit, we shut down their operations, and we strike fear in the hearts of their staff and their investors. Once Elbit Systems of America has been vanquished, we will have a replicable model for targeted direct action, which might be used to target every single conspirator in the occupation of Palestine and the subjugation of the colonized world.

Further, we absolutely uphold the necessity of mass demonstrations, marches, and softer forms of direct action. These are all elements of the elaborate tapestry of resistance, but marching alone isn‚Äôt enough. Thousands have been arrested in the US for civil disobedience since Oct 7; most of these arrests have been purely symbolic. Imagine if these bodies were blockading arms shipments, dismantling weapons companies, and actually threatening capital. 

Power has shown it doesn‚Äôt move, even when millions have taken the streets, unless their profits are directly affected, or ruling class fear abounds. Beware of those who wish to co-opt the language of Direct Action for the benefit of their own opportunism and brand-building. Beware of ‚ÄúShut it Down,‚Äù actions which are little more than theatrical performances, meant to contain the revolutionary instinct. 

For those who don‚Äôt live near a primary Elbit Systems location, there ARE targets near you. Bank of New York Mellon is Elbit System‚Äôs primary investor, along with being the fiscal sponsor for the Friends of the IDF, a non-profit which allows US citizens to materially support the Zionist Occupation Army. We have officially put Bank of New York Mellon on notice as a target of Palestine Action, and they are in major cities across the country and across the globe.

Use this map to find Elbit Systems or Bank of New York Mellon locations near you, connect with Palestine Action US, and build an affinity group today. 

Together, we become ungovernable, Together, we defeat the Zionist beast, beginning with Elbit Systems.

**De dag waarop de zomer over gaat in de herfst. De dag waarop de nacht langer wordt dan de dag, en de dagen donkerder worden.

De dag waarop onze voorouders de balans opmaakten van wat ze hadden verbouwd en verzameld, en zo konden zien of ze de winter zouden overleven.

In een symbolisch gebaar stonden wij stil bij wat wij dit jaar verbouwd en verzameld hebben, en hoe wij de donkere tijd die komt zullen gaan doorstaan.

**The autumnal equinox:

**The day when summer passes into autumn. The day when the night becomes longer than the day, and the days become essential.

The day when our ancestors took stock of what they had earned and collected, and thus could see whether they would survive the winter.

In a symbolic gesture, we reflected on what we have improved and collected this year, and how we will survive the dark times to come.
